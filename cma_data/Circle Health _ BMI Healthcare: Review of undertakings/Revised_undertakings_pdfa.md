# ACQUISITION BY CIRCLE HEALTH HOLDINGS LIMITED OF GHG HEALTHCARE HOLDINGS LIMITED

Undertakings given by Circle Health Holdings Limited to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Whereas:

(a) Circle Health Holdings Limited ( Circle ) completed the acquisition of GHG Healthcare Holdings Limited, a parent of BMI Healthcare Limited ( BMI ) on 8 January 2020 by way of the purchase of the entire issued share capital of BMI (the Transaction ) such that Circle and BMI ceased to be distinct for the purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act );

(b) Under section 22(1) of the Act the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) has a duty to refer a relevant merger situation for a Phase 2 investigation where it believes that it is or may be the case that the creation of that merger situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or services;

(c) Under section 73 of the Act the CMA may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it, accept undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate, from such of the parties concerned as it considers appropriate. In particular, the CMA shall have regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(d) As set out in the CMA’s decision of 8 April 2020 (the Decision ), the CMA believes that, in the absence of appropriate undertakings, it would be under a duty to refer the Transaction for a Phase 2 investigation;

(e) On 23 June 2020, the CMA accepted undertakings in lieu of reference under section 73(2) of the Act pursuant to which Circle agreed to divest Circle Hospital (Bath) Limited ( Circle Bath )and Circle Birmingham Limited ( Circle Birmingham Hospital ) to a purchaser or purchasers approved by the CMA by the end of the Divestiture Period ( Original UILs );

(f) On 1 June 2021, Circle completed the divestiture of Circle Bath to Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust. On 21 June 2021, Circle requested the CMA to vary the Original UILs insofar as they relate to the divestiture of Circle Birmingham Hospital. On 2 May 2024 the CMA issued its final decision, deciding that the Original UILs should be varied to give effect to a divestiture of The Edgbaston Hospital ( The Edgbaston Hospital or the Divestment Business ) instead of Circle Birmingham Hospital;

(g) The CMA considers that, together with the completed divestiture of Circle Bath pursuant to the Original UILs, the undertakings given below by Circle are appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from the Transaction, or may be expected to result from it, as specified in the Decision;

(h) Prior to the acceptance of these undertakings by the CMA, Circle entered into a legally binding asset purchase agreement on 27 March 2024 to divest the Divestment Business as a going concern to the Proposed Purchaser on terms approved by the CMA. This agreement was conditional only on formal CMA approval of the Proposed Purchaser and acceptance by the CMA of these undertakings. The asset purchase agreement includes a warranty that the Proposed Purchaser has the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Business as part of a viable and active business in competition with Circle and other competitors in the market for private hospital medical services in the UK; and

(i) With the exception of paragraph 12 (Continued Separation) in respect of Circle Bath, the Original UILs will cease to be in force on the date of acceptance by the CMA of the undertakings given below by Circle, which will supersede the Original UILs.

NOW THEREFORE Circle hereby gives to the CMA the following undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it.

# 1EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE UNDERTAKINGS

1.1 These undertakings shall take effect from the date that, having been signed by Circle, they are accepted by the CMA (the Effective Date).

1.2 The Original UILs will cease to have effect from the Effective Date, save for paragraph 12 (Continued Separation) in respect of Circle Bath which Circle agrees shall continue for a period of 10 years from the divestment of Circle Bath on 1 June 2021.

# 2DIVESTMENT OF THE DIVESTMENT BUSINESS

2.1 Circle shall ensure that the completion of the divestment of the Divestment Business to the Proposed Purchaser contemplated by the asset purchase agreement referred to in recital (h) of these undertakings takes place within a period not exceeding two months from the date these undertakings take effect.

2.2 Circle shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure the transfer of Key Staff with the divestment of the Divestment Business.

2.3 In the event that Circle fails to complete the divestment of the Divestment Business in accordance with paragraph 2.1 above, the CMA may, whether or not initiating the Trustee Functions as set out in paragraph 5 below, require Circle to divest the Divestment Business as a going concern at no minimum price to a purchaser or purchasers approved by the CMA.

3.1 For the purposes of the CMA approving a Proposed Purchaser and the terms of the divestment of the Divestment Business in accordance with these undertakings, Circle shall, save as required or permitted by the CMA, satisfy the CMA that:

(a) the acquisition by the Proposed Purchaser of the Divestment Business, on the terms set out above, remedies, mitigates or prevents the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it, or may be expected to result from it, in particular having regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(b) the Proposed Purchaser is independent of and unconnected to Circle and the Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate to which Circle belongs and any Associated Person or Affiliate of Circle or such Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate;

(c) the Proposed Purchaser has the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Business as a viable and active business in competition with Circle and other competitors in the market for private hospital medical services from the date of completion of the divestment of the Divestment Business;

(d) the Proposed Purchaser is reasonably to be expected to obtain all necessary approvals, licences and consents from any regulatory or other authority, including landlord’s consent to the transfer of any leasehold interest; and

(e) the acquisition by the Proposed Purchaser of the Divestment Business does not create a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK.

# Annex 1

# Description of the Divestment Business

The Edgbaston Hospital is operated by Circle Health Group Limited (company number 02164270) with registered address 1st Floor, 30 Cannon Street, London, EC4M 6XH. The Edgbaston Hospital is located at 22 Somerset Road, Birmingham B15 2QQ. The Edgbaston Hospital has three operating theatres and 31 registered beds in use; one additional ward (with 11 available beds) is currently used as a suite of offices.

The divestment of The Edgbaston Hospital will be brought about through a disposal of assets. The Edgbaston Hospital will be divested with all of the assets which are currently utilised by and/or necessary for the operation of the hospital, including:

a) where capable of being transferred and as agreed with the Proposed Purchaser, all or substantially all tangible and intangible assets which contribute to the current operation or are necessary to ensure the viability or competitiveness of the business, including:

i. the hospital building, infrastructure and fixtures;

ii. medical equipment, including all operating theatre and ward equipment; iii. beds, furniture and other furnishings; and

iv. local IT equipment and telephone systems;

b) where capable of being transferred and as agreed with the Proposed Purchaser, all or substantially all licences, permits, consents and authorisations issued by any governmental or regulatory organisation for the benefit of the business;

c) where capable of being transferred and as agreed with the Proposed Purchaser, all or substantially all contracts, leases, commitments and customer orders related to the Divestment Business, insofar as they relate to the Divestment Business; and

d) where capable of being transferred and as agreed with the Proposed Purchaser, and directly relevant for continuing operations, all customer, credit and other records related to or associated with the business.

Circle will enter into a leasehold surrender agreement with the landlord of the Edgbaston Hospital site (22 Somerset Road, Birmingham B15 2QQ) to terminate its leasehold interest and to enable the landlord (NWI Edgbaston J1 Limited and NWI Edgbaston J2 Limited) to enter into a new lease agreement with the Proposed Purchaser.

As an asset sale, it is expected that there will be no transfer of working capital with the business, which will be agreed with the Proposed Purchaser.

All employees are employed by Circle Health Group with the employee’s place of work specified as Edgbaston or Edgbaston and The Priory Hospital. As such, the Edgbaston Hospital has staff designated as Edgbaston staff on the payroll, approximately $\[{\\mathcal{A}}!\\ll!\],$ , who have worked across both of the Divestment Business and The Priory Hospital. The transfer of such staff to the Proposed Purchaser would be dependent on the application of TUPE.

The Edgbaston Hospital also has (non-employee) clinical and non-clinical bank staff and $\\mathbb{\\left\[\\mathcal{B}\\right\]}$ \]consultants with Practising Privileges. The Proposed Purchaser would have the option to attract these bank staff and consultants.

If requested by the Proposed Purchaser, a Transitional Services Agreement will be entered into for the provision of support relating to central services such as IT systems, payroll and accounts payable.
