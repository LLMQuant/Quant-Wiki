### Merger abandoned
14 August 2024: The anticipated acquisition by Scanpole Limited of Calders & Grandidge (Boston) Limited has been abandoned.
The CMA’s deadline for its phase 1 decision was 20 August 2024. The CMA received assurances from Scanpole, and on 12 August 2024 it was publicly announced, that the proposed merger had been abandoned. Therefore, the CMA has decided that it is not under a duty to refer the Merger as, pursuant to section 33(2)(b) of the Enterprise Act 2002, it believes that arrangements are not sufficiently far advanced, or are not sufficiently likely to proceed, to justify the making of a reference to phase 2.
### Launch of merger inquiry
25 June 2024: The CMA announced the launch of its merger inquiry by notice to the parties.

### Invitation to comment: Closes on 10 July 2024
26 June 2024: The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering whether it is or may be the case that this merger has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.
To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments on the transaction from any interested party.
These comments should be provided by the deadline set out above.
