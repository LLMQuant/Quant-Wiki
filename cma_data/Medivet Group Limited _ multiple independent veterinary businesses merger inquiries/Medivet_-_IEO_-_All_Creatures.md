# COMPLETED ACQUISITION BY MEDIVET GROUP LIMITED OF ALL CREATURES CLINIC LIMITED

Initial Enforcement Order made by the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act)

# Whereas:

(a) the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is or may be the case that Medivet Group Limited ( Medivet )and All Creatures Clinic Limited (the Relevant Vet Practice ) have ceased to be distinct;

(b) the CMA is considering, pursuant to section 22 of the Act, whether it is or may be the case that a relevant merger situation has been created and whether the creation of that situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in any market or markets in the United Kingdom (UK);

(c) Medivet is a private limited company which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Hecate Holdco Limited (UK) ( Hecate Holdco ) and indirectly held by CVC Capital Partners VIII (A) L.P., CVC Capital Partners VIII Associates L.P. and CVC Capital Partners Investment Europe VIII L.P., being funds managed by CVC Capital Partners VIII Limited ( CVC Capital );

(d) the CMA wishes to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of any reference under section 22 of the Act which might prejudice that reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA under Part 3 of the Act which might be justified by the CMA’s decisions on the reference; and

(e) the circumstances set out in section 72(6) of the Act do not apply and the reference has not been finally determined in accordance with section 79(1) of the Act.

Now for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action in accordance with section 72(2) of the Act the CMA makes the following order addressed to Medivet, Hecate Holdco, CVC Capital, CVC Capital Partners VIII (A) L.P., CVC Capital Partners VIII Associates L.P. and CVC Capital Partners Investment Europe VIII L.P.
