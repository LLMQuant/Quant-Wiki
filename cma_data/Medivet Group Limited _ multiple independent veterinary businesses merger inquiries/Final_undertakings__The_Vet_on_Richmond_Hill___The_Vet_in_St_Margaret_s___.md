# ACQUISITION BY MEDIVET GROUP LIMITED OF THE ASSETS AND BUSINESSES OF THE VETERINARY PRACTICES UNDER THE NAME OF THE VET ON RICHMOND HILL & THE VET IN ST MARGARET’S

Undertakings given by Medivet Group Limited to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Whereas:

(a) Medivet Group Limited ( Medivet ), being a private limited company which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Hecate Holdco Limited (UK) ( Hecate Holdco )and indirectly held by CVC Capital Partners VIII (A) L.P., CVC Capital Partners VIII Associates L.P. and CVC Capital Partners Investment Europe VIII L.P., being funds managed by CVC Capital Partners VIII Limited ( CVC Capital ) (together with Medivet, Hecate Holdco, CVC Capital Partners VIII (A) L.P., CVC Capital Partners VIII Associates L.P. and CVC Capital Partners Investment Europe VIII L.P., the Acquirer Group ), completed the acquisition of the assets and businesses of the veterinary practices under the name The Vet on Richmond Hill & The Vet in St Margaret’s ( The Vet on Richmond Hill & St Margaret’s or the Relevant Vet Practice ) on 1 September 2022 by way of asset purchase agreement (the Transaction ) such that Medivet and The Vet on Richmond Hill & The Vet in St Margaret’s ceased to be distinct for the purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act );

(b) Under section 22(1) of the Act the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA )has a duty to refer a relevant merger situation for a Phase 2 investigation where it believes that it is or may be the case that the creation of that merger situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or services; (c) Under section 73 of the Act the CMA may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it, accept undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate, from such of the parties concerned as it considers appropriate. In particular, the CMA shall have

regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(d) As set out in the CMA’s decision of 18 May 2023 (the Decision ), the CMA believes that, in the absence of appropriate undertakings, it would be under a duty to refer the Transaction for a Phase 2 investigation;

(e) The CMA considers that the undertakings given below by the Acquirer Group are appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from the Transaction, or may be expected to result from it, as specified in the Decision; (f) Prior to the acceptance of these undertakings by the CMA, Medivet entered into a legally binding agreement of 11 August 2023 to divest the Divestment Business as a going concern to a Proposed Purchaser on terms approved by the CMA. This agreement was conditional only on formal CMA approval of the Proposed Purchaser and acceptance by the CMA of these undertakings. This agreement includes a warranty that the Proposed Purchaser has the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Business as part of a viable and active business in competition with Medivet and other competitors in the market for the supply of small animal veterinary services in the areas listed in Annex A of the Decision (the SLC Areas ); and (g) The CMA made an Initial Enforcement Order applying to the Acquirer Group on 21 December 2022 (as varied) and 24 January 2023 in respect of the Transaction pursuant to section 72 of the Act for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action. Pursuant to section 72(6)(b) of the Act, this Initial Enforcement Order ceases to be in force on the acceptance by the CMA of the undertakings given below by the Acquirer Group.

NOW THEREFORE the Acquirer Group hereby gives to the CMA the following undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it.

1.1 These undertakings shall take effect from the date that, having been signed by the Acquirer Group, they are accepted by the CMA.

# 2DIVESTMENT OF THE DIVESTMENT BUSINESS

2.1 The Acquirer Group shall ensure that the completion of the divestment of the Divestment Business to the Proposed Purchaser contemplated by the agreement referred to in recital f of these undertakings takes place within a period not exceeding one month from the date these undertakings take effect.

2.2 Medivet shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure the transfer of Key Staff with the divestment of the Divestment Business.

2.3 In the event that the Acquirer Group fails to complete the divestment of the Divestment Business in accordance with paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 above, the CMA may, whether or not initiating the Trustee Functions as set out in paragraph 4 below, require the Acquirer Group to divest the Divestment Business as a going concern at no minimum price to a purchaser or purchasers approved by the CMA.

(a) the acquisition by the Proposed Purchaser of the Divestment Business, on the terms set out above, remedies, mitigates or prevents the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it, or may be expected to result from it, in particular having regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(b) the Proposed Purchaser is independent of and unconnected to the Acquirer Group and the Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate to which the Acquirer Group belongs and any Associated Person or Affiliate of the Acquirer Group or such Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate;

(d) the Proposed Purchaser is reasonably to be expected to obtain all necessary approvals, licences and consents from any regulatory or other authority, including (where applicable) landlord’s consent to the transfer of any leasehold interest; and
