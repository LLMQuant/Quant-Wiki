# SUMMARY

1. On 24 July 2023, Alumasc Group Plc ( Alumasc ) agreed, pursuant to a conditional share purchase agreement, to acquire the entire issued share capital of ARP Group Holdings Ltd ( ARPGH ) and Rainwater Online Holdings Limited ( ROH ) (the Target Group ) (the Merger ). Alumasc and the Target Group are together referred to as the Parties and, for statements relating to the future, the Merged Entity . The Parties overlap in the manufacture and supply of metal gutters, downpipes and architectural products in the United Kingdom ( UK ).

2. The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) believes that it is or may be the case that Alumasc and the Target Group are enterprises; that these enterprises will cease to be distinct as a result of the Merger; and that the share of supply test is met. Accordingly, arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation.

3. The CMA has assessed whether there is a realistic prospect that the Merger would give rise to a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in:


(a) the manufacture and supply of ‘premium’ (cast iron and cast aluminium) metal gutters and downpipes in the UK;

(b) the manufacture and supply of ‘mid-tier’ (extruded and pressed aluminium) metal gutters and downpipes in the UK;

(c) the supply of steel gutters and downpipes in the UK; and

(d) the manufacture and supply of architectural products in the UK.

4. In relation to the manufacture and supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes, the evidence received by the CMA indicates that the Parties are two of a number of competitors – including Hargreaves, PAM Saint-Gobain and ‘heritage look-alike’ extruded aluminium providers Marley Alutec and Guttercrest – that are competing relatively closely. While, on the basis of the CMA’s estimates, the Merged Entity will have a significant share of supply post-Merger, the evidence showed that the Merged Entity will continue to face strong competitive constraints from within and outside of the ‘premium’ segment, as well as constraints from smaller premium metal suppliers and heritage look-alike plastic suppliers.

5. In relation to the manufacture and supply of mid-tier metal gutters and downpipes, the evidence received by the CMA indicates that the Parties are two of a number of competitors that are competing relatively closely, with the Merged Entity being the largest supplier. However, the evidence showed that the Merged Entity will continue to face strong competitive constraints from Guttercrest and Marley Alutec as well as, to a lesser extent, from steel suppliers (in particular, Lindab). Other


smaller mid-tier suppliers will also continue to provide some constraint on the Merged Entity.

6. In relation to the supply of steel gutters and downpipes, the CMA found that, while the Parties are competing relatively closely, the Merged Entity will continue to face a range of constraints. These include strong constraints from the leading suppliers, Lindab and Kingspan, who both manufacture steel products in-house (whereas the Parties import steel products $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ for resale in the UK) as well as further constraint from smaller steel and mid-tier metal suppliers (and, to a lesser extent, plastic suppliers).
7. In relation to the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products, while the evidence received by the CMA indicates that the Parties compete, it also shows that the Merged Entity will continue to face a range of constraints. These include strong constraints from Guttercrest and Dales Fabrications as well constraints from a number of other metal suppliers, including Marley Alutec and Ash & Lacy Building Systems.
8. As a result, the CMA considers that there are sufficient remaining good alternatives to constrain the Merged Entity post-Merger in each of the markets considered above.
9. The CMA therefore does not believe that it is or may be the case that the Merger may be expected to result in an SLC within a market or markets in the UK.
10. The Merger will therefore not be referred under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ).

# ASSESSMENT

# PARTIES, MERGER AND MERGER RATIONALE

11. On 24 July 2023, Alumasc agreed, pursuant to a conditional share purchase agreement, to acquire the entire issued share capital of the Target Group for maximum cash consideration of £10 million.

12. Alumasc is a UK-based company listed on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market. Alumasc manufactures and supplies building products, systems and solutions, including metal gutters, downpipes and architectural products. The turnover of Alumasc in its financial year ending 30 June 2023 was £89.1 million worldwide and £84.1 million in the UK.

13. ARPGH is a non-trading UK holding company with one wholly owned subsidiary, Aluminium Roofline Products Limited ( ARP ). ARP manufactures and supplies metal gutters, downpipes and architectural products. The turnover of ARPGH in its financial year ending 30 June 2023 was approximately $\\pmb{\\upxi}\[\\mathcal{Y}\]$ million worldwide, of which approximately $\\pmb{\\upxi}\[\\mathcal{Y}\]$ million was generated in the UK.

14. ROH is a non-trading, UK holding company with two wholly owned subsidiaries, Cast Iron Superstore and Envelope Solutions Ltd, trading as Gutters Online. Both subsidiaries resell ARP’s gutters, downpipes and architectural products. The turnover of ROH in its financial year ending 30 June 2023 was approximately $\\pmb{\\upxi}\[\\mathcal{Y}\]$ million worldwide, $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ which was generated in the UK.

15. Alumasc submitted that the main strategic rationale for the Merger is to expand the range of products available to its customers – in particular, seamless aluminium 8–and to generate cost synergies and savings $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .Additionally, Alumasc submitted that it saw potential for the Merger to strengthen $\[\\mathcal{J}<\],$ , create cross-selling opportunities 10 and increase the penetration of metal rainwater gutters, downpipes and architectural products into the plastic rainwater segment.

16. Alumasc’s internal documents reviewed by the CMA are consistent with this rationale.


# JURISDICTION

17. Each of Alumasc and the Target Group is an enterprise. As a result of the Merger, these enterprises will cease to be distinct.

18. In the financial year ending 30 June 2023, the Target Group generated turnover of less than £70 million in the UK. Accordingly, the turnover test set out in section 23(1)(b) of the Act is not met.

19. According to share of supply estimates submitted by the Parties and the CMA’s share of supply estimates, the Merged Entity would have a combined share of supply exceeding $25%$ , with an increment resulting from the Merger, in:


(a) the manufacture and supply of ‘premium’ metal gutters and downpipes in the UK (by value); 13

(b) the manufacture and supply of ‘mid-tier’ metal gutters and downpipes in the UK (by value); 14 and

(c) the manufacture and supply of architectural products in the UK (by value).

20. The CMA therefore believes that the share of supply test in section 23(2)(b) of the Act is met.

21. The CMA therefore believes that it is or may be the case that arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation.

22. The initial period for consideration of the Merger under section 34ZA(3) of the Act started on 30 October 2023 and the statutory 40 working day deadline for a decision is therefore 22 December 2023.


# COUNTERFACTUAL

23. The CMA assesses a merger’s impact relative to the situation that would prevail absent the merger (ie the counterfactual).

24. In an anticipated merger, the counterfactual may consist of the prevailing conditions of competition, or conditions of competition that involve stronger or weaker competition between the parties to a merger than under the prevailing conditions of competition. In determining the appropriate counterfactual, the CMA will generally focus on potential changes to the prevailing conditions of competition only where there are reasons to believe that those changes would make a material difference to its competitive assessment.

25. In this case, the CMA has not received submissions or other evidence to suggest that the Merger should be assessed against an alternative counterfactual. Therefore, the CMA believes the prevailing conditions of competition to be the relevant counterfactual.


# COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT

# Market definition

26. The assessment of the relevant market is an analytical tool that forms part of the analysis of the competitive effects of the Merger. It involves identifying the most significant competitive alternatives available to customers of the Parties and includes the sources of competition to the Parties that are the immediate determinants of the effects of the Merger. However, the CMA’s assessment of competitive effects of the Merger does not need to be based on a specific description of any particular market (including, for example, descriptions of the precise boundaries of the relevant markets and bright-line determinations of whether particular products or services fall within it). In this context, the CMA has identified below the appropriate market definition for use in its assessment of the competitive effects of the Merger.

27. The Parties’ main areas of overlap include the following: 22


(a) the manufacture and supply of different types of metal (cast iron, cast aluminium, extruded aluminium and pressed aluminium) gutters and downpipes; 23

(b) the supply of steel gutters and downpipes; and

(c) the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products.

# Product market

28. The CMA considered whether it was appropriate to identify separate product markets by reference to: (i) product type (gutters and downpipes separately from architectural products); (ii) material type; and (iii) sales channel. In its assessment, the CMA had particular regard to demand-side factors (ie the behaviour of customers).

# Product type

29. The Parties submitted that gutters, downpipes and architectural products should all be considered together within the same product market.

30. Architectural products serve a fundamentally different function to that of gutters and downpipes.


(a) Gutters are pipes or troughs which are horizontally attached to the side of a building to collect and carry rainwater towards a downpipe. Downpipes are made up of a long pipe attached vertically to the side of a building and carry rainwater from the gutter to a drainage system. Both products are designed to collect rainwater, operating together to form a ‘rainwater system’.

(b) Architectural products broadly include fascias, soffits, copings, door canopies, window surrounds, windowsills and column casings. These products are used for the roofline, envelope and critical junctions in a building structure.

31. Consistent with this, evidence from third parties indicated that gutters and downpipes are typically sold together. One competitor explained that they usually supply gutters and downpipes together as they are part of the same system, whereas architectural products are not (and may be sold separately). It was

noted that customers generally do not mix and match gutters and downpipes from different suppliers as they prefer a more consistent appearance 29 and sometimes products are not compatible with different suppliers’ products.

32. The Parties’ internal documents regularly monitor manufacturers and suppliers of gutters and downpipes together, but separately to architectural products.

33. On the basis of the evidence set out above, for the purpose of its assessment of the competitive impact of the Merger, the CMA considered it appropriate to identify separate product markets for the manufacture and supply of gutters and downpipes, on the one hand, and the manufacture and supply of architectural products on the other. The CMA further considered whether it was appropriate to further subsegment these product markets by reference to material type and sales channel, as set out below.


Gutters and downpipes Material type

34. The Parties submitted that all metal and plastic gutters and downpipes (together with architectural products) should be considered together within the same product market.

35. The CMA considered whether metal and plastic gutters and downpipes are close substitutes and the extent to which the different types of metal gutters and downpipes supplied by both Parties are close substitutes to each other. In its assessment, the CMA considered evidence about product characteristics and use cases, the alternatives identified by customers and competitors and evidence from the Parties’ internal documents.


Plastic

36. Neither party supplies plastic gutters and downpipes (or architectural products). While plastic gutters and downpipes serve the same end function as metal gutters and downpipes, there are significant differences in their product characteristics as compared to metal alternatives. Plastic gutters and downpipes are significantly

cheaper 34 and easier to install, have a much shorter lifespan (around 12 - 20 years, as compared with 20 – 50 years for metal counterparts), have more burdensome maintenance requirements and are not recyclable.

37. Evidence from third parties that responded to the CMA’s investigation indicated that, for gutters and downpipes, plastic is a weaker alternative to metal than different types of metal are to each other. Consistent with this, the Parties’ internal documents showed that other metal gutter and downpipe rivals are consistently monitored by the Parties, whereas rival suppliers of plastic products are referenced infrequently. In addition, almost all of the competitors supplying metal gutters and downpipes do not supply plastic alternatives, indicating a lack of supply-side substitution.

38. The CMA therefore considered that, on the basis of the evidence set out above, plastic and metal gutters and downpipes should not form part of the same product market, although the CMA has taken into account the constraint from suppliers of plastic products where appropriate in the competitive assessment.


Cast iron and cast aluminium

39. Both Parties manufacture and supply cast iron and cast aluminium gutters and downpipes. The Parties submitted that a product market of ‘premium’ (cast iron and cast aluminium) metal gutters is not appropriate as there is significant substitutability between ‘premium’ metal gutters and downpipes and plastic and ‘mid-range’ metal products.

40. There are some differences in the product characteristics of cast iron and cast aluminium gutters and downpipes: cast iron is heavier, slightly more expensive and has greater longevity, whereas cast aluminium is cheaper and lighter, making it easier and safer to install. However, they are similar in that, as compared to other metal products, they are both significantly more expensive, last longer (around 45 – 50 plus years, as compared with 20 – 40 years for other metal counterparts) and are typically used by end users who are looking for a specific aesthetic.

41. Cast iron and cast aluminium gutters and downpipes are typically used on heritage or ‘traditional look’ buildings. A small subset of end users are required to use cast iron gutters and downpipes as result of the project being a listed building where a like-for-like replacement is required. However, the CMA found that cast aluminium heritage look-alike products 46 are considered strong alternatives to cast iron, as they have a similar aesthetic, are high quality products that last longer and are significantly more expensive than other metal products.

42. There was some variation in the views of customers and competitors who responded to the CMA’s investigation. Overall cast aluminium was frequently identified by third parties as an alternative to cast iron gutters and downpipes (and vice versa). Other alternatives to cast iron mentioned less frequently were extruded aluminium heritage look-alike products, and plastic heritage look-alike products. Extruded aluminium products were occasionally mentioned as an alternative to cast aluminium products.

43. Alumasc’s internal documents consistently considered cast iron and cast aluminium together as ‘traditional ranges’, separately from ‘contemporary ranges’.

44. On the basis of the evidence set out above, the CMA found that cast iron and cast aluminium gutters and downpipes should be considered together within the ‘premium ’ segment of metal gutters and downpipes. The extent to which other materials provide a level of competitive constraint is discussed in further detail in the competitive assessment.


Extruded aluminium, pressed aluminium and steel 45. Both Parties manufacture and supply extruded aluminium and pressed aluminium gutters and downpipes. The Parties submitted that a product market of ‘midrange’ (pressed and extruded aluminium) is not appropriate as there is significant substitutability between mid-range metal gutters and downpipes and steel, seamless aluminium and plastic alternatives.

46. Both Parties supply steel aluminium gutters and downpipes although neither of the Parties manufacture these products, and instead only resell them in the UK. The Parties submitted that a product market of ‘steel’ is not appropriate as there is significant substitutability between steel gutters and downpipes and cheaper alternatives such as seamless aluminium and plastic.

47. The CMA considered whether pressed and extruded aluminium gutters and downpipes should be considered within the same product market as each other, as well as whether steel gutters and downpipes should be considered part of this market.

48. Extruded aluminium and pressed aluminium gutters and downpipes are predominantly used for buildings with a more contemporary aesthetic. Extruded and pressed aluminium are similarly high quality, last for a similar length of time (around 35 – 40 years) and are at a comparable price point. Some extruded aluminium products are designed to be heritage look-alike products and therefore may be closer alternatives to cast iron and cast aluminium gutters. Steel gutters and downpipes have a contemporary look similar to pressed and extruded aluminium products, however there are differences in the price and quality of steel gutters and downpipes (which last for around 20 – 35 years). Suppliers of steel gutters and downpipes are generally different to those manufacturing and supplying aluminium products, indicating a lack of supply-side substitution.

49. There was some variation in the views of customers and competitors who responded to our investigation. Overall, extruded aluminium was often identified as an alternative to pressed aluminium, and vice versa. While several third parties considered steel to be an alternative to extruded and/or pressed aluminium products, some others highlighted the differences in price and quality of steel products compared with extruded and pressed aluminium. One aluminium competitor noted it doesn’t ‘come across’ steel products often.

50. Evidence from the Parties’ internal documents indicated that competitive conditions in the supply of steel products differ from those in the supply of extruded and pressed aluminium. While Alumasc’s internal documents consistently monitored extruded and pressed ‘contemporary’ aluminium ranges together, the Parties’ internal documents monitored steel products separately to aluminium gutters and downpipes.

51. Overall, on the basis of the evidence considered above, the CMA found that the manufacture and supply of pressed and extruded aluminium gutters and downpipes should be considered together within the ‘ mid-tier ’ segment, separate from the supply of steel gutters and downpipes. The extent to which each of these provide a level of competitive constraint on the other is discussed in the competitive assessment.


# Sales channel

52. The Parties’ sales channels for the supply of gutters and downpipes include 69 sales to merchants, contractors 71 and directly to end users 72 as well as online sales (which may be to any customer, although a large proportion of online customers are contractors). Merchants purchase products from manufacturers and suppliers which are then sold to contractors, installers, or end users.

53. The Parties submitted that, while manufacturers and suppliers of gutters and downpipes may have a commercial strategy to generate sales through either merchants or contractors, most supply products across all sales channels. As a result, the Parties submitted that it is not necessary to segment the market further by reference to these different sales channels.

54. Merchant and contractor customers both supply gutters and downpipes to all end users and projects. However, it is architects and designers who typically specify the manufacturer’s products required for a project (referred to as specification ). While this may limit what products contractors and merchants can offer, in the majority of these cases, contractors may be permitted to change specified products for equivalent or approved products. This allows contractors to


substitute the products required for reasons such as price, availability or ease of installation.

55. Consistent with the Parties’ submissions, most manufacturers and suppliers the CMA engaged with throughout its investigation were active in the supply of products across all sales channels.

56. Therefore, on the basis of the evidence set out above, the CMA did not consider it necessary to segment the product market by sales channel. Differences in suppliers' commercial strategies with respect to sales channel is considered where relevant in the competitive assessment below.


Architectural products

57. Both Parties manufacture and supply metal architectural products using aluminium fabrications, predominantly pressed aluminium.

58. The Parties submitted that a product market for the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products (separate from gutters and downpipes) was not appropriate as a result of the significant supply-side substitution between these products. As discussed at paragraphs 29 - 33, the CMA found that architectural products should be considered separately to gutters and downpipes.

59. While the Parties also submitted that they compete closely with suppliers of plastic and wood architectural products, the CMA found evidence of differences in quality, maintenance and lifespan between metal and plastic architectural products. In addition, due to existing and proposed fire safety regulations, some end users may be required to use aluminium architectural products instead of plastic or other combustible materials such as wood.

60. No third party indicated that either wood or plastic architectural products could be used as a substitute for metal architectural products. Consistent with this, other metal architectural product rivals are consistently monitored by the Parties in their internal documents, whereas plastic architectural product suppliers are rarely


mentioned. Additionally, almost all of the competitors supplying metal architectural products do not supply plastic or wood architectural products, indicating a lack of supply-side substitution.

61. As most metal architectural products are made with pressed aluminium, the CMA did not find any evidence of there being a significant distinction by the type of metal used in architectural products, as was the case for gutters and downpipes. 62. As a result, the CMA found that metal architectural products should be considered separately from the manufacture and supply of plastic architectural products.

# Geographic market definition

63. The Parties submitted that the market for the supply of rainwater management solutions (including metal and plastic gutters, downpipes and architectural products) is national in scope, covering the whole of the UK.

64. The Parties submitted that competition from suppliers based outside of the UK is more limited. Consistent with this, the Parties’ internal documents largely discuss business plans and strategy on a UK basis 96 and the vast majority of suppliers indicated that they distribute gutters and downpipes and/or architectural products throughout the UK. In addition, the vast majority of customers indicated that they would not consider importing products or using suppliers from outside of the UK. As such, the CMA considers that the geographic scope of the each of the product markets identified above is the UK.


# Conclusion on market definition

65. For the reasons set out above, the CMA has considered the impact of the Merger in relation to the following markets:

(a) the manufacture and supply of premium (cast iron and cast aluminium) metal gutters and downpipes (referred to as premium metal or premium gutters and downpipes) in the UK;

(b) the manufacture and supply of mid-tier (extruded and pressed aluminium) metal gutters and downpipes (referred to as mid-tier metal or mid-tier gutters and downpipes) in the UK;

(c) the supply of steel metal gutters and downpipes in the UK; and

(d) the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products in the UK.

# Theories of harm

66. The CMA assesses the potential competitive effects of mergers by reference to theories of harm. Theories of harm provide a framework for assessing the effects of a merger and whether or not it could lead to an SLC relative to the counterfactual.

67. In its investigation, the CMA considered whether the Merger could lead to an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in each of the frames of reference set out above at paragraph 65. Each of these theories of harm is considered below.

68. Horizontal unilateral effects may arise when one firm merges with a competitor that previously provided a competitive constraint, allowing the merged entity profitably to raise prices or to degrade quality on its own and without needing to coordinate with its rivals.


# TOH 1: Horizontal unilateral effects in the manufacture and supply of ‘premium’ metal gutters and downpipes in the UK

69. The CMA has assessed whether it is or may be the case that the Merger may be expected to result in an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in the manufacture and supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes in the UK. In its assessment, the CMA has considered: (i) shares of supply; (ii) the closeness of competition between the Parties; and (iii) the competitive constraint from alternative suppliers that will remain post-Merger. The CMA has taken into account in its assessment evidence from the Parties and from competitors and customers.

Shares of supply

70. The Parties provided estimated shares for the manufacture and supply of ‘premium’ metal gutters and downpipes in the UK by value. According to these estimates, the Merged Entity would have a share of supply of $\[3<\]%$ , with an increment of $\[3<\]%$ resulting from the Merger. The next largest suppliers would be Hargreaves Foundry Drainage ( Hargreaves ) (with $\[3<\]%)$ , PAM Saint-Gobain $(\[3<\]%)$ and Marley Alutec $(\[3<\]%)$ . The Parties identified a tail of smaller suppliers, including Longbottoms, Tuscan Foundry, Hall & Botterill, Stormguard and Rainwater Direct (with an estimated combined share of $(\[3<\]%)$ .

71. The CMA estimated shares for the manufacture and supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes by value using sales data provided by the Parties and thirdparty suppliers. These estimates are set out in Table 1.


Table 1: CMA estimates of shares of the manufacture and supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes in the UK in 2022, by value (£)

![](/tmp/98fa8eee-a8da-46c1-affd-adf9e10a4702/images/28b13f97a2f5cbc55e19a471e1bf430b48a43bcf37990077346b1dd7282291b9.jpg)

Source: CMA analysis, using sales data provided the Parties and third parties Notes:

1Target Group sales do not include any downpipe sales for cast aluminium. The Target Group records all of its aluminium downpipe sales as extruded aluminium. Allocating cast aluminium downpipe sales to the Target Group by using Alumasc's ratio of gutters and downpipe sales, would add $\\mathcal{E}\[\\mathcal{H}\]$ to the Target Group’s cast aluminium sales and only result in a small increase in the Target Group’s shares of supply to $I10{-}2O J%$ , with the Merged Entity having a combined share of $\[50–60J%$ .\
\
2\[\]. Only downpipes sales are included in the CMA estimates for Guttercrest.\
\
3The total is predominately made up of cast iron sales with smaller sales of cast aluminium products, with cast iron making up £\[ \]and cast aluminium $\\pm\[{\\mathcal{H}}\].$\
\
72. According to the CMA’s estimates, the Merged Entity would be the largest supplier, with a share of supply of $\[50{-}60\]%$ and an increment of $\[10{-}20\]%$ resulting from the Merger. Hargreaves would be the next largest supplier, with \[30- $40\]%$ , followed by PAM Saint-Gobain $(\[5-10\]%)$ , Hall & Botterill $(\[5-10\]%)$ and Guttercrest $(\[0-5\]%)$ .\
\
73. While, according to the CMA’s estimates, the Parties’ combined share of supply is high, the CMA notes the following limitations with its estimates, which mean that they are likely to understate the constraint remaining from alternatives postMerger:\
\
\
(a) They do not capture the constraint provided by heritage look-alike extruded aluminium suppliers. In particular, the CMA received evidence that Marley Alutec's and Guttercrest’s heritage look-alike products will continue to\
\
exercise a strong constraint on the Merged Entity (see paragraphs 103 – 106 below).\
\
(b) They do not capture the presence of other manufacturers of cast iron gutters and downpipes identified by the Parties and third parties, namely, Longbottoms, Rainwater Direct, and Tuscan Foundry.\
\
74. Therefore, while the CMA considers that these share of supply estimates provide useful information about the structure of the market and the relative presence of other suppliers, this information must be considered in the round with other evidence on the competitive constraints remaining post-Merger.\
\
Closeness of competition\
\
75. The Parties submitted that they are not each other’s closest competitor and that all suppliers compete fiercely against each other, notwithstanding that some suppliers have a more limited product offering. The Parties submitted that Alumasc considers its closest competitors to be suppliers which focus on brand reputation, achieving specification and sales to merchants 106 whereas the Target Group focuses on offering lower prices and sales to contractors.\
\
76. In differentiated markets, horizontal unilateral effects are more likely where the merger firms are close competitors or where their products are close substitutes. In its assessment of the degree of closeness of competition between the Parties, the CMA has considered evidence from the Parties’ internal documents and the views of customers and competitors, as well as other evidence on the Parties’ strategic focus.\
\
77. In their internal documents, the Parties regularly identify each other as competitors. However, both Parties’ internal documents also monitor other competitors to a similar extent, indicating that the Parties are not competing with each other more closely than other competitors.\
\
78. The majority of third parties that responded to the CMA’s investigation identified both Parties as suppliers of premium metal gutters and downpipes. Customers and competitors identified Alumasc as a supplier a similar number of times as the Target Group, but considered Alumasc to have a stronger product offering. Two competitors also told the CMA that Alumasc is a stronger competitor than the Target Group, with another competitor noting that the Target Group’s products are of lesser quality to both Alumasc and other competitors. Overall, the third party responses suggested that the Parties do not compete significantly more closely with each other as compared to others, with Hargreaves being identified a similar number of times, and PAM-Saint Gobain, Marley Alutec and Guttercrest (the latter two supplying heritage lookalike extruded aluminium products) being identified a significant number of times albeit slightly less frequently, compared to the Parties.\
\
79. The CMA received some evidence of differentiation in the Parties’ offering by sales channel. Consistent with the Parties’ submissions, the majority of Alumasc’s sales of premium gutters and downpipes is to merchants $(\[\\mathcal{Y}\]$ of 2022 sales by revenue), while the Target Group predominantly sells via contractors – which requires less technical quotation work because contractors have generally already been awarded the relevant work and understand their requirements 116 – and its online channels (with $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ of its sales being made to merchants). Alumasc focuses on ‘achieving’ specifications 118 – which involves competing in particular on quality and brand (and is associated with a higher price point) – whereas the Target Group (and a set of suppliers who also operate this business model such as Guttercrest, Yeoman Rainguard (Harrison Thompson & Co Ltd) ( Yeoman ), Hall & Botterill, and Tuscan Foundry and Stormguard 119 ) attempt to ‘break’ specifications on the basis of price, quote turnaround time and manufacturing lead time. Consistent with this, the Target Group’s products are $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ than Alumasc’s, however, as discussed above its product quality is seen as lesser as compared to Alumasc and other competitors.\
\
80. Overall, the evidence indicates that the Parties are two of a number of competitors – including Hargreaves, PAM Saint-Gobain and ‘heritage lookalike’ extruded aluminium providers Marley Alutec and Guttercrest – that are competing relatively closely. The CMA has considered the constraint remaining from these and other alternative suppliers post-Merger below.\
\
\
Competitive constraints\
\
81. The Parties submitted that their main competitors in the manufacture and supply of cast iron and cast aluminium gutters and downpipes are PAM Saint-Gobain, Hargreaves, Rainwater Direct, Marley Alutec and Guttercrest. The Parties also submitted that for heritage or ‘traditional look’ buildings they compete with extruded and cast iron look-alike plastic, while for customers wanting a high-end contemporary look, they compete with extruded aluminium and steel suppliers. 82. When considering horizontal unilateral effects, the CMA’s main consideration is whether there are sufficient remaining good alternatives to constrain the merged entity post-merger. In its assessment of the constraints that will remain postMerger, the CMA has assessed the following suppliers and the extent to which they will continue to provide a competitive constraint on the Merged Entity:\
\
(a) Hargreaves;\
\
(b) PAM Saint-Gobain;\
\
(c) Hall & Botterill;\
\
(d) other cast iron suppliers;\
\
(e) heritage look-alike extruded aluminium suppliers; and (f) heritage look-alike plastic suppliers.\
\
Hargreaves\
\
83. Hargreaves manufactures and supplies cast iron gutters and downpipes in the UK, and typically sells via merchants. Hargreaves also has technical capabilities and can take on large bespoke projects, whereas neither of the Parties have the same level of facilities.\
\
84. The CMA estimates that, post-Merger, Hargreaves would be the second largest supplier after the Merged Entity, with a share of supply of $\[30{-}40\]%$ (see Table 1). Hargreaves’ strength is also recognised in customer responses to the CMA’s investigation, with the majority identifying it as a competitor to the Parties and several referencing the high quality of its products. One customer noted that it considered Hargreaves to be one of Alumasc’s main competitors in cast iron, along with PAM Saint-Gobain.\
\
85. Almost all competitors considered Hargreaves to be a strong competitor in premium metal gutters and downpipes. For example, one competitor considered Hargreaves as the market leader, and two others considered Hargreaves as one of the main cast iron suppliers.\
\
86. The Parties’ internal documents also recognise Hargreaves as a main competitor, with both of them $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .An Alumasc’s internal document states that Hargreaves is $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ for cast iron, while the Target Group considers it a key competitor in cast iron.\
\
87. Therefore, the CMA considers that, post-Merger, Hargreaves would continue to exercise a strong constraint on the Merged Entity in the supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes, in particular those made of cast iron.\
\
88. PAM Saint-Gobain manufactures and supplies cast iron gutters and downpipes in the UK, mainly through merchants. The Parties noted that it is regularly specified, although $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .\
\
89. The CMA estimates that PAM Saint-Gobain’s share of supply for premium gutters and downpipes is $\[5-10\]%$ (see Table 1). PAM Saint-Gobain’s sales have $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ in the last five years, in part due to it deciding that these products $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .\
\
90. The majority of customers that responded to the CMA’s investigation considered that PAM Saint-Gobain is a competitor to the Parties. One customer considered PAM Saint-Gobain to be one of Alumasc’s main competitors in cast iron, along with Hargreaves, while another stated that it was a market leader with a high quality product. Several competitors also noted that PAM Saint-Gobain has a good quality product. However, one competitor also noted that it seems to be focusing on different areas of its business and is not selling as much as it previously did.\
\
91. The Parties’ internal documents recognise PAM Saint-Gobain as a competitor and show that the Parties $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .For example, Alumasc’s internal sales reports include discussion of $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ .\
\
92. Therefore, the CMA considers that PAM Saint-Gobain would exercise a strong constraint, but to a lesser extent than Hargreaves, on the Merged Entity in the supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes, in particular those made of cast iron.\
\
\
# Hall & Botterill\
\
93. Hall & Botterill supplies a wide range of cast aluminium gutters and downpipes. It supplies these products to all customer groups, as well as to manufacturers of other types of gutters and downpipes that then resell them. One such manufacturer is $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ ,which recently began manufacturing a new range of downpipes to be used with cast aluminium gutters.\
\
94. The CMA estimates that Hall $&$ Botterill’s share of supply for premium gutters and downpipes is $\[5-10\]%$ (see Table 1). However, considering Hall & Botterill and $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ together, their combined share is $\[5-10\]%$ .\
\
95. While Hall & Botterill was not identified as a supplier by name by customers, several of the manufacturers reselling Hall & Botterill's products – including $\[3<\]^{152}$ were regularly mentioned by customers. As a result, the CMA considers that its products are a constraint on the Parties, but customers may be less aware of Hall & Botterill as a supplier because of its different route to market. It was only mentioned by one competitor, which considered Hall & Botterill to be one of the main suppliers of cast aluminium products.\
\
96. In the Parties’ internal documents, references to Hall & Botterill are $\[\\mathcal{J}<\].$ . One document indicated that Alumasc $\[3<\]^{155}$ and another from the Target Group also noted Hall & Botterill as a competitor. However, the competitors through which Hall & Botterill supplies its products are $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ monitored in the Parties’ internal documents.\
\
97. Therefore, the CMA considers that Hall & Botterill would exercise some constraint on the Merged Entity in the supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes, in particular those made of cast aluminium.\
\
\
Other cast iron suppliers\
\
98. Other smaller cast iron suppliers include Longbottoms, Rainwater Direct and Tuscan Foundry.\
\
99. Longbottoms was mentioned by two customers. One noted that it had excellent bespoke products but was very expensive 159 and the other that it had a good range of products and was used for more specialised orders. It was also mentioned by two competitors, however both considered it to be relatively small. The Parties’ internal documents mention Longbottoms infrequently, with only $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ Alumasc documents noting it $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .\
\
100. Rainwater Direct was mentioned by only one customer, which noted that its product was priced low but also of lower quality. It was mentioned by two competitors, one considering that it was the fourth largest supplier of cast iron products in the UK, but that it had fallen behind the other providers. The other competitor considered Rainwater Direct to be just a small cast iron supplier. The Parties’ internal documents mention Rainwater Direct rarely, with only $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ Alumasc documents noting it $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .\
\
101. Tuscan Foundry was only mentioned by one customer 167 and the CMA has seen no evidence of either of the Parties $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .\
\
102. Overall, the CMA considers that these other cast iron suppliers, considered together, would provide some constraint on the Merged Entity in the supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes, particularly those made of cast iron. Heritage look-alike extruded aluminium suppliers 103. Some extruded aluminium gutters and downpipes are designed to look like heritage cast iron products. Marley Alutec and Guttercrest are two of the main suppliers of heritage look-alike extruded aluminium gutters and downpipes.\
\
103. The Parties submitted that Marley Alutec manufactures and supplies cast aluminium gutters and downpipes in the UK, and some third parties referred to Marley Alutec’s product as cast aluminium. However, Marley Alutec stated that most of its aluminium guttering is extruded aluminium and other competitors also described Marley Alutec’s product as extruded aluminium. Regardless, Marley Alutec considered that its heritage look-alike extruded aluminium $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ .Several third parties considered Marley Alutec’s product to be competing for customers wanting premium metal gutters and downpipes. As discussed in paragraph 133, the Parties’ internal documents also recognise Marley Alutec as a main competitor. Marley Alutec’s sales of heritage look-alike extruded aluminium gutters and downpipes in 2022 were $\\pmb{\\Sigma}\[\\mathcal{Y}\]$ ,which is similar to the Target Group’s sales (by value) of premium metal gutters and downpipes.\
\
104. In addition to the cast aluminium downpipes that Guttercrest supplies in the UK, it also manufactures and supplies a range of extruded aluminium products, including heritage look-alike extruded aluminium products, which customers sometimes choose over cast iron. One customer also considered Guttercrest’s gutters and downpipes as competing for customers wanting premium metal gutters and downpipes. Several competitors considered Guttercrest’s products to be an alternative to premium gutters and downpipes. As discussed in paragraph 129, the Parties’ internal documents also recognise Guttercrest as a main competitor. Guttercrest’s sales of extruded aluminium gutters and downpipes, which they note often have a heritage profile, were $\\pmb{\\upxi}\[\\mathcal{Y}\]$ in 2022, which is significantly larger than the Target Group’s sales (by value) of premium gutters and downpipes.\
\
105. Therefore, the CMA considers that heritage look-alike extruded aluminium suppliers (particularly Marley Alutec and Guttercrest) would continue to exercise a strong constraint on the Merged Entity in the supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes.\
\
\
Heritage look-alike plastic suppliers\
\
107. Some plastic gutters and downpipes are designed to look like heritage cast iron products and the Parties submitted that these products compete with cast iron and cast aluminium gutters and downpipes.\
\
108. The main suppliers of heritage look-alike plastic are Wavin, Brett Martin, Polypipe, and Aliaxis (the parent company of Marley Alutec). Several customers considered at least one of these plastic suppliers to be competing with the Parties in the manufacture and supply of premium gutters and downpipes. The CMA has seen one internal document from the Parties $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ ,and another document $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ .185 However, no competitor listed a plastic provider as an alternative to premium metal gutters and downpipes, with one noting that for heritage buildings, customers will choose metal products over plastic as it is hard to achieve the look these customers require with plastic.\
\
109. Therefore, the CMA considers that heritage look-alike plastic suppliers would exercise some constraint, although weaker than metal alternatives, on the Merged Entity in the supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes.\
\
\
# Third-party views\
\
110. The majority of customers who engaged with the CMA did not raise any concerns in relation to the Merger for any of the areas of overlap. A few customers indicated that they supported the Merger, with one customer suggesting it may improve investment in the Target Group’s manufacturing processes. A small number of customers raised concerns, noting a lack of alternative suppliers remaining and indicating that the Merger would reduce competition. However, the evidence examined by the CMA from the Parties’ internal documents and from customers and competitors indicates that a range of suppliers will remain to constrain the Merged Entity.\
\
111. Almost all of the competitors who engaged with the CMA raised no concerns in relation to premium gutters and downpipes. One competitor indicated that the Merger could lead to more concentration in the supply of cast iron products. However, as discussed above, the CMA found that, considering the evidence received in its investigation together in the round, cast iron and cast aluminium providers compete closely and sufficient competition will remain to constrain the Merged Entity, post-Merger.\
\
112. The limited number of concerns from third parties is consistent with the evidence above on the strength of the constraints from remaining competitors.\
\
\
# Conclusion on TOH 1\
\
113. For the reasons set out above, the evidence received by the CMA in its investigation indicates that the Parties are two of a number of competitors that are competing relatively closely in the supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes, with the Merged Entity having a significant share of supply of \[50- $60\]%$ . However, the evidence also showed that the Merged Entity will continue to face strong competitive constraints from within and outside of the ‘premium’ segment. In particular, Hargreaves, PAM Saint-Gobain, and other heritage lookalike extruded aluminium suppliers (particularly Marley Alutec and Guttercrest), will continue to provide a strong competitive constraint post-Merger. A range of smaller premium metal gutters and downpipes suppliers as well as heritage lookalike plastic suppliers will also continue to provide some constraint on the Merged Entity.\
\
114. Accordingly, the CMA believes that the Merger does not give rise to a realistic prospect of an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in relation to the manufacture and supply of premium metal gutters and downpipes in the UK.\
\
\
# TOH 2: Horizontal unilateral effects in the manufacture and supply of ‘mid-tier’ metal gutters and downpipes in the UK\
\
115. The CMA assessed whether it is or may be the case that the Merger has resulted, or may be expected to result, in an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in the manufacture and supply of mid-tier metal gutters and downpipes in the UK. In its assessment, the CMA has considered: (i) shares of supply; (ii) the closeness of competition between the Parties; and (iii) the competitive constraint from alternative suppliers that will remain post-Merger. The CMA has taken into account in its assessment evidence from the Parties and from competitors and customers.\
\
# Shares of supply\
\
116. The Parties provided estimates of their share of the manufacture and supply of ‘mid-tier’ metal gutters and downpipes in the UK by value. According to these estimates, the Merged Entity would have a share of supply of $\[3<\]%$ , with an increment resulting from the Merger of $\[3<\]%$ . The next largest suppliers would be Guttercrest (with a share of $\[3<\]%)$ , Marley Alutec $(\[3<\]%)$ , Yeoman $(\[3<\]%)$ and Dales Fabrications $(\[3<\]%)$ .\
\
117. The CMA estimated shares for the manufacture and supply of mid-tier gutters and downpipes by value using sales data provided by the Parties and third-party suppliers. These estimates are set out in Table 2. The CMA’s estimates are broadly consistent with those of the Parties.\
\
\

\
Source: CMA analysis, using sales data provided the Parties and third parties Notes: 1. Target Group sales include all of its aluminium downpipe sales (including cast aluminium and seamless aluminium). 2. Parties’ estimate. 3. Includes all Yeoman’s gutter and downpipe sales.\
\
118. According to the CMA’s estimates, post-Merger, the Merged Entity would be the largest supplier with a share of $\[30-40%\]$ , with an increment of $\[10{-}20\]%$ resulting from the Merger. Guttercrest would be the next largest supplier, with $\[20{-}30\]%$ ,followed by Marley Alutec $(\[20.30\]%)$ , Dales Fabrications $(\[5-10\]%)$ , Yeoman (\[5- $10\]%)$ and Guttermaster $(\[0.5\]%)$ .\
\
119. While these share estimate capture significant constraints from a range of other suppliers, the share estimates have some limitations in that:\
\
\
(a) they do not capture the presence of other manufacturers of mid-tier metal gutters and downpipes identified by the Parties 197 and third parties; 198 and (b) they do not capture the constraint from steel suppliers (which, as discussed in paragraphs 138 to 141, provide a moderate constraint on the Merged Entity) and from, to a lesser extent, cast aluminium, seamless aluminium and plastic gutters and downpipes suppliers.\
\
120. Therefore, while the CMA considers that these share of supply estimates provide useful information about the structure of the market and the relative presence of other suppliers, this information must be considered in the round together with other evidence on the competitive constraints remaining post-Merger.\
\
Closeness of competition\
\
121. The Parties’ submissions on closeness set out at paragraph 75 above also apply to the manufacture and supply of mid-tier gutters and downpipes.\
\
122. Similarly, the evidence from the Parties’ internal documents discussed at paragraph 77 above applies for both ‘premium’ and ‘mid-tier’ gutters and downpipes. As with the manufacture and supply of ‘premium’ gutters and downpipes, Alumasc’s main route to market for ‘mid-tier’ metal gutters and downpipes is via merchants (accounting for $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ of its sales by revenue in 2022), while the Target Group predominantly sells via contractors and its online channels (with only $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ of its sales by revenue in 2022 being via merchants).\
\
123. Less than half of customers that responded to the CMA’s investigation identified both the Parties as suppliers of ‘mid-tier’ metal gutters and downpipes. Overall, customer responses suggested that the Parties do not compete significantly more closely with each as compared to others, with Guttercrest, Marley Alutec and, to a lesser extent, steel provider Lindab being identified similarly frequently as compared to the Parties. Competitors also identified Guttercrest and Marley Alutec as suppliers to a similar extent as they did the Parties. One competitor noted that the Target Group’s products are of lesser quality to both Alumasc and other competitors.\
\
124. Overall, the evidence indicates that the Parties are two of a number of competitors that are competing relatively closely, including in particular Guttercrest and Marley Alutec and, to a lesser extent, steel provider Lindab. The CMA has considered the constraint remaining from these and other alternative suppliers post-Merger below.\
\
\
Competitive constraints\
\
125. The Parties submitted that they compete with other suppliers of extruded aluminium and pressed aluminium gutters and downpipes, including Guttercrest, Marley Alutec, Yeoman and Dales Fabrications. The Parties also submitted that for customers particularly concerned with cost, they compete with steel, seamless aluminium and plastic suppliers. On the other hand, customers looking for greater longevity may decide to use a more expensive cast aluminium supplier. 126. In its assessment of the constraints that will remain post-Merger, the CMA has assessed the following suppliers and the extent to which they will continue to provide a competitive constraint on the Merged Entity post-Merger:\
\
(a) Guttercrest;\
\
(b) Marley Alutec;\
\
(c) other extruded and pressed aluminium suppliers;\
\
(d) steel suppliers; and (e) cast aluminium, seamless aluminium and plastic suppliers.\
\
# Guttercrest\
\
127. Guttercrest manufactures and supplies extruded and pressed aluminium gutters and downpipes in the UK (including the heritage look-alike extruded aluminium product discussed in paragraph 103 above) mainly via merchants. It also has the ability to make bespoke aluminium products and generally has the fastest delivery times.\
\
128. The CMA estimates that, post-Merger, Guttercrest would be the second largest supplier after the Merged Entity, with a share of supply of $\[20{-}30\]%$ (see Table 2). Guttercrest was also identified as a supplier by the majority of customers that responded to the CMA’s investigation. One customer considered Guttercrest to be Alumasc’s second closest competitor after Marley Alutec. All but one competitor also considered Guttercrest to be a competitor.\
\
129. The Parties’ internal documents show that they consider Guttercrest to be one of their main competitors, with the Parties $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .\
\
130. Therefore, the CMA considers that Guttercrest would continue to exercise a strong constraint on the Merged Entity.\
\
\
# Marley Alutec\
\
131. Marley Alutec manufactures and supplies a range of extruded aluminium gutters and downpipes (including the heritage look-alike extruded aluminium product discussed in paragraph 104 above). Marley Alutec supplies a range of different customers, including merchants, contractors, installers, and end users.\
132. According to the CMA’s estimates, Marley Alutec would be the third largest supplier post-Merger, with a share of supply of $\[20{-}30\]%$ (see Table 2). Almost half of the customers that responded to the CMA’s investigation considered Marley Alutec to be a competitor, with one customer considering it to be Alumasc’s closest competitor. All but one competitor that responded to the CMA investigation considered Marley Alutec to be a competitor. Two competitors also stated that they considered Marley Alutec to be one of the Parties’ closest competitors.\
133. The Parties’ internal documents show that they consider Marley Alutec to be one of their main competitors, with the Parties $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ .\
134. Therefore, the CMA considers that Marley Alutec would continue to exercise a strong constraint on the Merged Entity.\
\
Other extruded and pressed aluminium suppliers\
\
135. Other smaller mid-tier suppliers include Dales Fabrications, Yeoman, Guttermaster, and Ash & Lacy. The Parties and some third parties also identified further smaller providers.\
136. Some of these suppliers were mentioned as alternatives by customers, and competitors. These suppliers are also monitored in the Parties’ internal documents (although not as regularly as Guttercrest and Marley Alutec).\
137. The CMA therefore considers that these smaller suppliers would continue to exercise some constraint on the Merged Entity.\
\
Steel suppliers\
\
138. As discussed at paragraph 49, steel gutters and downpipes are considered by multiple third parties (including the majority of customers that responded to the CMA’s investigation) 225 as an alternative to mid-tier metal products. Although steel has a similar price point to plastic, it is similar in quality to mid-tier metal products. As discussed in paragraph 123, customer responses to the CMA’s investigation identified Lindab slightly less frequently than the Parties, Guttercrest and Marley Alutec.\
\
139. Lindab and Kingspan are two of the main suppliers of steel gutters and downpipes (as discussed in paragraph 151). The Parties’ estimate of Lindab’s UK steel sales in 2022 is $\\pmb{\\Sigma}\[\\mathcal{Y}\]$ ,which is similar to Alumasc’s revenue generated from sales of $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ metal gutters and downpipes in 2022. Kingspan’s sales were $\\pounds\[3<\],229$ which is similar to the Target Group’s revenue generated from sales of mid-tier metal gutters and downpipes.\
\
140. The Parties’ internal documents show that Lindab is regularly monitored by the Parties and is considered to be the $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ in steel. The CMA did not see evidence in the Parties’ internal documents that $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ .\
\
141. The CMA therefore considers that these steel suppliers (Lindab in particular) would continue to exercise a moderate constraint on the Merged Entity.\
\
\
Cast aluminium, seamless aluminium and plastic suppliers 142. The Parties identified that cast aluminium, seamless aluminium and plastic products are on occasion used instead of mid-tier products. However, only one customer considered a cast aluminium supplier or a seamless aluminium supplier as an alternative to mid-tier products, while another customer considered a plastic supplier as an alternative. One competitor considered a cast aluminium rival as an alternative, and one competitor considered a seamless aluminium rival as an alternative. No competitors consider a plastic supplier as an alternative.\
\
143. The Parties’ internal documents discuss cast aluminium rivals in relation to mid-tier gutters and downpipes rarely (as set out in paragraph 96). In relation to seamless aluminium, the Parties’ internal documents show that the Target Group considers its seamless aluminium sales separately to its other products, while Alumasc considered that adding the Target Group’s seamless aluminium product would add to its range and allow it to compete more directly with plastic. The Parties’ internal documents infrequently reference rival suppliers of plastic products.\
\
144. Therefore, the CMA considers that suppliers of cast aluminium, seamless aluminium and plastic would only exercise a weak constraint on the Merged Entity.\
\
\
Third-party views\
\
145. As discussed at paragraph 110, most customers who engaged with the CMA raised no concerns with respect to the Merger.\
\
146. The majority of competitors who engaged with the CMA raised no concerns with respect to the manufacture and supply of mid-tier metal gutters and downpipes. A small number of competitors indicated that the Merger may result in market concentration in the manufacture and supply of aluminium gutters and downpipes. One referred to share of supply estimates indicating a high level of concentration, which differ substantially from the CMA’s estimates using data supplied by the Parties and third parties. Another indicated that the Merger would ‘reduce competition’ among aluminium suppliers. As discussed above, the CMA found that there are a number of remaining competitors, including (extruded and pressed) aluminium suppliers and steel suppliers, to constrain the Merged Entity post-Merger.\
\
\
# Conclusion on TOH 2\
\
147. For the reasons set out above, the evidence received by the CMA in its investigation indicates that the Parties are two of a number of competitors that are competing relatively closely in the supply of mid-tier metal gutters and downpipes, with the Merged Entity being the largest supplier post-Merger, with a share of \[30- $40\]%$ . The evidence also showed that the Merged Entity will continue to face strong competitive constraints from Guttercrest and Marley Alutec as well as, to a lesser extent, from steel suppliers (in particular, Lindab). Other smaller mid-tier suppliers will also continue to provide some constraint on the Merged Entity.\
\
148. Accordingly, the CMA believes that the Merger does not give rise to a realistic prospect of an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in relation to the manufacture and supply of mid-tier gutters and downpipes in the UK.\
\
\
# TOH 3: Horizontal unilateral effects in the supply of steel gutters and downpipes in the UK\
\
149. The CMA assessed whether it is or may be the case that the Merger has resulted, or may be expected to result, in an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in the supply of steel gutters and downpipes in the UK. The CMA has considered evidence from the Parties and from competitors and customers.\
\
150. The CMA estimated shares for the supply of steel gutters and downpipes by value in the UK using sales data provided by the Parties and third parties. These estimates are set out in Table 3.\
\

\
Source: CMA analysis using sales data provided the Parties and third parties. Notes: 1. Parties’ estimate.\
\
151. According to the CMA’s estimates, the Merged Entity would be the third largest supplier with a share of $\[10-15\]%$ and an increment resulting from the Merger of \[0- $5\]%$ .Lindab would remain the leading supplier with a share of $\[50{-}60\]%$ ,followed by Kingspan with a share of $\[30{-}40\]%$ and smaller suppliers, in particular Ash $&$ Lacy with a share of $\[0.5\]%$ .\
\
152. Alumasc and the Target Group both source steel gutters and downpipes from $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ .247 Alumasc $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ and the Target Group is a $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ products within the UK. By contrast, Lindab and Kingspan both manufacture their steel products in-house, with Lindab being one of the only European manufacturers of steel products that also has its own distribution capabilities in the UK.\
\
153. The Parties’ internal documents show that, while they monitor each other’s steel gutters and downpipes, they similarly monitor those of Lindab, who the Target Group considers to be the $\[\\mathcal{J}!<!\]$ .Overall, they show that the Parties monitor competitors in the supply of steel gutters and downpipes less frequently than premium and mid-tier metals.\
\
154. In addition to constraint from other steel suppliers, the Merged Entity will continue to face constraint from suppliers of mid-tier gutters and downpipes and, to a lesser extent, plastic. A few third parties considered mid-tier metal products to be an alternative to steel products, and a small number of third parties indicated that plastic is an alternative to steel.\
\
155. No competitors raised concerns in relation to the supply of steel gutters and downpipes. One customer raised a concern that the Merger may reduce competition in relation to the supply of steel gutters and downpipes. However, as discussed above, the CMA considers that alternative suppliers will remain postMerger to sufficiently constrain the Merged Entity.\
\
156. Overall, while the evidence received by the CMA indicates that the Parties are competing relatively closely, it also shows that the Merged Entity will continue to face a range of constraints. These include strong constraints from Lindab and Kingspan, as well as further constraint from smaller steel and mid-tier metal suppliers (and to a lesser extent, plastic). The CMA considers that these constraints, taken together, are sufficient to constrain the Merged Entity postMerger.\
\
157. Based on the evidence above, the CMA believes that the Merger does not give rise to a realistic prospect of an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in relation to the supply of steel gutters and downpipes in the UK.\
\
\
# TOH 4: Horizontal unilateral effects in the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products in the UK\
\
158. The CMA assessed whether it is or may be the case that the Merger has resulted, or may be expected to result, in an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products in the UK. The CMA has considered evidence from the Parties and from competitors and customers. 159. The CMA estimated shares for the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products in the UK by value using sales data provided by the Parties and third parties. These estimates are set out in Table 4.\
\

\
Source: CMA analysis, using sales data provided by the Parties and third parties Notes 1. Parties’ estimate.\
\
160. According to the CMA’s estimates, the Merged Entity would be the largest supplier with a combined share of $\[30{-}40\]%$ and an increment of $\[5-10\]%$ resulting from the Merger. The next largest supplier would be Ash $&$ Lacy, with $\[20{-}30\]%$ , followed by Guttercrest $(\[20{-}30\]%)$ and several smaller suppliers, including Dales Fabrications, Marley Alutec and Yeoman, each having a share of supply between 5 and $10%$ .\
\
161. While the Parties’ internal documents show that they monitor each other’s $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ ,they also show that they monitor $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ a range of other suppliers, including Guttercrest, Alugutter, Dales Fabrications, Marley Alutec 263 and Ash & Lacy.\
\
162. Evidence from third parties also highlighted a number of constraints that would remain post-Merger. Guttercrest and Dales Fabrications were viewed by several third parties as the Parties’ strongest competitors. Customers indicated that both Guttercrest and Dales Fabrications have high quality architectural products that are competitive on price, while one competitor described Guttercrest as the ‘market leader’. In addition, a few third parties noted that there is an 'extensive' number of other alternative suppliers, indicating some constraint on the Merged Entity from smaller suppliers.\
\
163. No customers raised concerns in relation to the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products. One competitor raised a concern that the Merged Entity would ‘dominate’ the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products. However, this competitor referred to Alumasc already having a high share of supply in metal architectural products (based on estimates that differed substantially from the CMA’s estimates using data supplied by the Parties and third parties) and did not identify the Target Group as a main competitor.\
\
164. Overall, while the evidence received by the CMA indicates that the Parties compete in the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products, it also shows that the Merged Entity will continue to face a range of constraints. These include strong constraints from Guttercrest and Dales Fabrications as well constraints from a number of other metal suppliers, which, taken together, are sufficient to constrain the Merged Entity post-Merger.\
\
165. For the reasons set out above, the CMA believes that the Merger does not give rise to a realistic prospect of an SLC as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in the manufacture and supply of metal architectural products in the UK.\
\
\
# ENTRY AND EXPANSION\
\
166. Entry, or expansion of existing firms, can mitigate the initial effect of a merger on competition, and in some cases may mean that there is no SLC.
