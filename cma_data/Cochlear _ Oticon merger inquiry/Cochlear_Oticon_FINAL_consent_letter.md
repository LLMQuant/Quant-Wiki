Dear Mr Parker,

Under the Initial Order, save for written consent by the CMA, Demant and Oticon Medical, are required to refrain from taking any action which might prejudice a reference of the transaction under section 22 or 33 of the Act or impede the taking of any remedial action which may be justified by the CMA’s decisions on such a reference.

After due consideration of your request for derogations from the Initial Order, based on the information received from you and in the particular circumstances of this case, the CMA consents to Demant and Oticon Medical carrying out the following actions, in respect of the specific paragraphs:
