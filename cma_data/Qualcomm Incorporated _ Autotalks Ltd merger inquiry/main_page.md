## Phase 1
### Merger abandoned
25 March 2024: The anticipated acquisition by Qualcomm Incorporated of Autotalks Ltd has been abandoned.
The CMA’s deadline for its phase 1 decision was 25 April 2024. The CMA received assurances from Qualcomm on 15 and 22 March 2024 that the proposed merger had been abandoned. Therefore, the CMA has decided that it is not under a duty to refer the Merger as, pursuant to section 33(2)(b) of the Enterprise Act 2002, it believes that arrangements are not sufficiently far advanced, or are not sufficiently likely to proceed, to justify the making of a reference to phase 2.
### Launch of merger inquiry
27 February 2024: The CMA announced the launch of its merger inquiry by notice to the parties.

### Invitation to comment: closed
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.
To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments on the transaction from any interested party, in advance of the CMA’s formal investigation starting.
These comments should be provided by the deadline set out above.
