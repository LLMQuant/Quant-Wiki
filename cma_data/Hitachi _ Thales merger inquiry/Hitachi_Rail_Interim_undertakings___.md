# ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION BY HITACHI RAIL, LTD. OF THALES SA's GROUND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS BUSINESS

Undertakings given by Hitachi Rail Limited to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 80 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Background

A. On 23 December 2022, in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act), the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) referred the anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail Limited of Thales SA's Ground Transportation Systems Business (the Merger) (together the Merger Parties) to its chair for the constitution of a group of CMA Panel Members (the Inquiry Group) (the Reference) to determine in accordance with section 36 of the Act:

a. whether arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation; and,

b. if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.

B. The period within which the report on the Reference is to be made (the reference period) was extended under section 39(4) ofthe Act on 23 December 2022, and further extended by a Notice of Extension under section 39(2) of the Act published on 27 July 2023. The extended reference period is due to expire on 6 October 2023.

C. The CMA published its Provisional Findings Report and the Notice ofPossible Remedies on 8 June 2023. The CMA provisionally found that:

a. Arrangements were in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, would result in the creation of a relevant merger situation; and

b.The creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition (SLC) as a result of horizontal unilateral effects within: i. The market for digital mainline signalling systems and related services (digital mainline signalling systems) in Great Britain (GB); and ii. The market for the supply of communications-based train control (CBTC) signalling systems and related service in the United Kingdom.

E. The Reference has not been finally determined in accordance with section 79(1) of the Act. The CMA wishes to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of the Reference which might prejudice that Reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA under Part 3 of the Act which might be justified by the CMA's decisions on the Reference.
