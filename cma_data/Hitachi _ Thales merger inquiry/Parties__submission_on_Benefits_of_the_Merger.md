1.2 As explained in the Parties' previous submissions, the Proposed Transaction does not give rise to a substantial lessening of competition in any segment. Rather, the merged entity will be able to offer better solutions and provide stronger competition than either Party individually across a number of regions, including in the UK.

1.3 First, the combined skills, knowledge, resources and experiences of Hitachi Rail and the Target will build a stronger challenger to Siemens and Alstom-Bombardier globally.

pricing and services for the customer.

1.4 Second, the Proposed Transaction will enable Hitachi Rail and the Target 1.6 Fourth, the Proposed Transaction will allow the merged entity to benefit from economies of scale, improved procurement processes and associated cost savings for the ultimate benefit of its customers globally and in the UK.

# 2\. STRONGER CHALLENGER TO SIEMENS AND ALSTOM-BOMBARDIER

2.1 Following the Proposed Transaction, the merged entity will be able to draw upon a deeper pool of global resources to compete more effectively with Siemens and AlstomBombardier and to support the development of new products and services to the benefit of customers.

A Mainline signalling in the UK

, through the Proposed Transaction, the merged entity will be better placed with a broader global expertise and full ETCS signalling portfolio (see paragraph 2.14 below) to more credibly challenge the UK duopoly of Siemens and AlstomBombardier.

2.3 Hitachi Rail and the Target are very small players in the UK mainline signalling sector, as previously described.1 The move to digital signalling (when it happens) is not expected, on its own, to address the dominance of Siemens and Alstom-Bombardier.2 Individually, neither Party will be able to materially challenge the significant and entrenched dominant position of the duopoly. However, by combining the Parties' resources, the merged entity will be a much stronger challenger in the UK.

2.9 Second, as a larger UK signalling organisation,

The Proposed Transaction would result in the Target becoming a core part of a larger rail-sector organisation, where signalling employees will be highly valued. This is a particularly important factor given the boom-and-bust Â° nature of signalling procurement in the UK,

See, ORR Signalling Market Study Final Report, para 7.15: A concern expressed by a number of current and prospective signalling suppliers is that there is a cycle of boom and bust' in the industry, whereby a steep ramp-up in work in the later years of a control period is followed by a sudden drop in work towards the end of the control period, and the start of the next period.

2.10 An increase in local capabilities of the breadth described above is expected to increase the competitiveness of the merged entity and to provide the following important benefits for customers:

As a result, the merged entity would have a greater local footprint in the UK, that would allow it to provide greater customer service, deploy deeper local expertise and experience (at lower costs).

customers would benefit from improved project management and more efficient project delivery.

D), the merged entity will be a stronger competitor than either Party individually because it could draw on the best skills, knowledge and experiences of both Parties to put together a compelling submission.

2.12 Even a small increase in the merged entity's ability to challenge the incumbents would produce rivalry-enhancing benefits given the structure of the industry

increase competition.

# BUrban signalling worldwide

2.16 Hitachi Rail is a vertically integrated supplier of rolling stock and CBTC solutions. However,

the Target has experience of delivering complex brownfield CBTC signalling solutions, including in London, but is not vertically integrated.

2.17 Accordingly, in circumstances where customers launch bundled tenders for CBTC and rolling stock8, the merged entity would be a stronger competitor to Siemens and AlstomBombardier (who are the only suppliers presently able to deliver complex brownfield CBTC signalling projects together with rolling stock in the $\\mathrm{EEA+UK}$ 0. While this is not relevant in the UK (given that future tenders for CBTC signalling are expected to be in London, where Transport for London has a practice of tendering separately for 8As mentioned in the FMN (Chapter 2, para 14.32.4), TfL typically tenders CBTC signalling separately to rolling stock.

rolling stock and signalling) elsewhere in the world, customers may elect to procure bundled tenders of rolling stock together with CBTC signalling in order to reduce integrationrisks increase efficiency and in many cases, lower costs from a staffing perspective

# 3\. STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT BETWEEN HITACHIRAIL AND THE TARGET

# Bidding for urban and mainline signalling tenders

3.1 As previously explained, responding to a tender is time-intensive and requires suppliers to carefully assess the business case for pursuing a given project against the context of their wider priorities and overall strategy.? Suppliers assess tenders on a case-by-case basis, and it does not follow from merely having a presence in a given country that a supplier will compete for a tender in that country. Both Parties are global companies that are constantly assessing opportunities indifferent countries with varying degrees of attractiveness (includingl

3.2 The bidding data shows that neither of the Parties participated in $\\lvert%$ of contestable mainline and urban tenders across the $\\mathrm{EEA+UK}$ over the period 2012 to 2021.10 For of these tenders, the only competitors were Siemens and/or AlstomBombardier.

3.3 Post-Proposed Transaction, the merged entity would have:

(a) greater resources than either Party currently; and (b) a higher confidence of winning tenders than either Party individually as a result of the Parties' combined track record and geographic complementarity.

3.4 These factors should lead the merged entity to compete in tenders that neither Party would otherwise have considered, 3.5 In addition, these factors together with the operational synergies described in section 5 would enable the merged entity to dedicate greater resources\[\

high entry barriers 3.6 For the reasons outlined in this submission, the Parties expect that the merged entity will be a stronger and more successful competitor globally than either Party individually.\
\
3.7 As a larger signalling player, with a real likelihood of challenging Siemens and AlstomBombardier globally, including in the UK, the merged entity will be set its offering apart from those of Siemens and Alstom-Bombardier.\

\
4.3 The merged entity will be active across a larger range of rail sector technology. Specifically:\

(a) the Target is active in the supply of Communication and Supervision Systems, such as passenger information systems and supervision systems and Ticketing and Fare Collection\

# 5\. REDUCED COSTS\

5.1 Hitachi Rail expects that the Proposed Transaction will give rise to synergies in relation to purchasing conditions.\

\
5.2 5.3 Hitachi Rail also expects that the Proposed Transaction would generate some synergies in the supply chain, through for instance,\

\
5.4 These improvements to the merged entity's procurement and supply chain would result in reduced costs and ultimately, better terms for the end customer.\

\
5.5 Following completion of the Proposed Transaction, where the merged entity is awarded conventional or ETCS wayside re-signalling projects, it will be able to source in-house. This in-sourcing of certain technologies will lead to reduced costs, due to the elimination of double marginalisation, and therefore benefit UK customers.\

\
6.2 the Proposed Transaction is expected to result in important benefits for customers and competition in the UK. In particular, the Proposed Transaction would allow the merged entity to present a more credible challenge to the duopoly of Siemens and Alstom-Bombardier in mainline signalling. Moreover,\
\
the Target would benefit from greater investment, and growth opportunities. In addition, the complementarity of the Parties' technological capabilities creates potential for the provision of a more comprehensive suite of digital mobility solutions on a larger scale, while the combination of the Parties' resources and commercial infrastructure will provide for better resource utilisation, improved procurement process and associated cost savings.
