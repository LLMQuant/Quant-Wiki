Notice of Acceptance of Additional Final Undertakings pursuant to sections 41, 82 and 90 of and schedule 10 to the Enterprise Act 2002

# Background

1. On 23 December 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), referred the anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail Limited ( Hitachi Rail ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hitachi, Ltd ( Hitachi ) of the Ground Transportation Systems business (the Target ) (the Merger ) carried on by Thales SA ( Thales )(Hitachi and Thales together, the Parties ), to a group of CMA panel members (the Reference ) to determine, pursuant to section 36 of the Act whether:

(i) arrangements are in progress or contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation; and

(ii) the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom ( UK ) for goods or services.

2. On 3 August 2023, the CMA accepted interim undertakings (Interim Undertakings) from Hitachi Rail pursuant to section 80 of the Act for the purpose of preventing pre-emptive action in accordance with that section. On 8 August 2023, the CMA issued written directions under the Interim Undertakings for the appointment of a monitoring trustee (the Monitoring Trustee) in order to monitor and ensure Hitachi Rail’s compliance with the Interim Undertakings.

3. The CMA published a final report pursuant to section 38 of the Act, titled ‘Anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail, Ltd of Thales SA's Ground Transportation Systems Business’ (dated 4 October 2023) (the Report ) which concluded, among other things, that:


I. the Merger if carried into effect may be expected to result in the creation of a relevant merger situation;

II. the Merger may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) as a result of horizontal unilateral effects arising from overlaps between the Parties in the supply of digital mainline signalling systems and related services in Great Britain;

III. the CMA should take action to remedy the SLC and any adverse effects resulting from it; and

IV. Hitachi Rail should divest its mainline signalling business in France, Germany and the UK (including staff, technology, and a production and R&D site) as described in the Report (the Divestment Business ) (the Primary Divestiture Remedy ).

4\. The Report also provided that in the event that customer consent from each of Network Rail, SNCF and Deutsche Bahn to the transfer of their Backlog Contracts $\[{\\mathcal{A}}\]$ to the Approved Purchaser is not obtained within the Divestiture Period (as defined in the Final Undertakings), prohibition would be an effective and proportionate alternative remedy to the SLC and any adverse effects arising from it (the Alternative Remedy ).

5\. On 17 November 2023, the CMA published a notice and consultation on a proposal to accept Additional Final Undertakings. The consultation closed on

1 December 2023. No representations were received.

6\. On 7 December 2023, the CMA accepted Final Undertakings from the Parties under section 82(2) of the Act, giving effect to the Primary Divestiture Remedy as published in the Final Report.

7\. The Final Undertakings will cease to be in force should the Alternative Remedy come into force in accordance with paragraph 2.1.1 of these Additional Final Undertakings. Any derogations already granted by the CMA pursuant to the Final Undertakings shall remain applicable.

8\. The CMA under section 82(2) of the Act, now accepts those Additional Final Undertakings as given by the Parties. A copy of the Additional Final Undertakings is attached. The Additional Final Undertakings now come into force and the reference is finally determined.

9\. The Additional Final Undertakings may be varied, superseded or released by the CMA pursuant to section 82(2) of the Act.

10\. This notice and a non-confidential version of the Additional Undertakings will be published on the CMA website. The CMA has excluded from the nonconfidential version of the Additional Final Undertakings information which it considers should be excluded, having regard to the considerations set out in section 244 of the Act. These omissions are indicated by $\[{\\mathcal{Z}}\]$ .
