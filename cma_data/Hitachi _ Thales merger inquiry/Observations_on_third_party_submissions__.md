# Case ME/6971/21 – Observations on third party submissions in response to the CMA's Provisional Findings and Remedies Notice

1. We refer to the submissions by Network Rail, Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (" CAF "), Wabtec and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (" RMT ") in response to the CMA's Provisional Findings and/or Remedies Notice as recently published on the CMA's website. The Parties do not intend to comment in detail but have made certain observations below in relation to each of these submissions.

Network Rail's Submission

It therefore faces strong reputational incentives to avoid disrupting the procurement and to avoid the perception of having preconceived views about the competitiveness of potential bidders in the TCSF. We have considered Network Rail’s views against this backdrop …Network Rail’s view about the Merger appear to be based on the current conditions of competition and, \[redacted\], Network Rail also told us that there were few differences in the ultimate capabilities of the Parties, Siemens, and Alstom .

Further, even if Network Rail wished to avoid the public perception of having preconceived views of the competitiveness of potential bidders, this does not apply to the views it has shared with the CMA on a confidential basis. The CMA cannot therefore discount Network Rail's statements in response to the Provisional Findings.
