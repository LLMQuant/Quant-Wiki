f) the identity of the Authorised Individual(s) cannot be changed without prior consultation with the Hold Separate Manager; in such circumstances within two working days of changing the identity of an Authorised Individual, Hitachi Rail will inform the CMA and the Monitoring Trustee of the identity of the additional Authorised Individual (name, job title) and their role/function as an Authorised Individual;

g) each of the Authorised Individuals has entered into a Non-Disclosure Agreement in a form approved by the CMA, which imposes appropriate restrictions on the disclosure, storage and use of the Confidential Information; h) no later than $\[{\\mathcal{Q}}\\ll\]$ , any records or copies (electronic or otherwise) of the Confidential Information, including business secrets, know-how, commerciallysensitive information, intellectual property or any other information of a confidential or proprietary nature, wherever they may be held, that were received from the Divestment Business for the purposes of this derogation will be returned to the Divestment Business and any copies destroyed, except to the extent that is strictly necessary for any Confidential Information to be retained by the Authorised Individuals to provide further support to the Divestment Business in relation to $\[{\\mathcal{Q}}\\ll\]$ , as may be agreed between Hitachi Rail and the Divestment Business, where the terms of such further support to the Divestment Business shall be subject to the CMA’s approval;

i) all electronic files and emails exchanged in this context will be adequately ringfenced and accessible only by the Authorised Individuals; and
