# 1\. Background

1.1 On 23 December 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), referred the anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail Limited ( Hitachi Rail ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hitachi, Ltd ( Hitachi ) of the Ground Transportation Systems business (the Target ) (the Merger ) carried on by Thales S.A. ( Thales )(together, the Parties ), for further investigation and report by a group of CMA panel members.

1.2 The CMA published a final report pursuant to section 38 of the Act, titled ‘Anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail, Ltd of Thales SA's Ground transportation Systems Business’ (dated 4 October 2023) (the Report ) which concluded, among other things, that:

1.2.1 the Merger may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) as a result of horizontal unilateral effects arising from overlaps between the Parties in the supply of digital mainline signalling systems and related services in Great Britain;

1.2.2 the CMA should take action to remedy the SLC and any adverse effects resulting from it;

1.2.3 Hitachi Rail divest its mainline signalling business in France, Germany and the UK (including staff, technology, and a production and R&D site) as described in the Report and in Annex 1 (the Divestment Business )(the Primary Divestiture Remedy ); and

1.2.4 in the event that customer consent from Network Rail, SNCF and Deutsche Bahn to the transfer of their Backlog Contracts $\[{\\mathcal{Q}}\\ll\]$ to the Approved Purchaser of the Divestment Business is not obtained within the Divestiture Period ,prohibition of the Merger would be an effective and proportionate alternative remedy (the Alternative Remedy ).

1.3 On \[Date\] the CMA accepted Final Undertakings from Hitachi Rail pursuant to section 82 of the Act, for the purpose of giving effect to the Primary Divestiture Remedy (the Final Undertakings ).

1.4 Now therefore, in order to give effect to Hitachi’s obligations under the Primary Divestiture Remedy and if necessary, the Parties’ obligations under the Alternative Remedy in the event the necessary customer consents are not obtained within the time permitted, the Parties provide the following Additional Final Undertakings to the CMA pursuant to section 82 of the Act, (the Additional Final Undertakings ).
