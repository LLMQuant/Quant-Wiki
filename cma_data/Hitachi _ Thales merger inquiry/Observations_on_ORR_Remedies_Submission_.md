# Case ME/6971/21 – Observations on the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) submission in response to the CMA's Remedies Notice

We refer to the ORR's advisory submission of 27 June 2023 (the “Submission” ) in response to the CMA's Remedies Notice, which sets out its advice on potential remedies should the CMA conclude that the proposed acquisition by Hitachi Rail, Ltd. (" Hitachi Rail ") of the entire Ground Transportation Systems business of Thales SA (together with Hitachi Rail, the "Parties ") is likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of digital mainline signalling.

As the ORR noted, it did not have the benefit of access to the Parties' remedies submissions in preparing its Submission. Accordingly, the Submission should be seen as a theoretical assessment of what a suitable remedies package might include. Indeed, the Parties do not agree with all aspects of the Submission, in particular the section on “practical considerations and the timing of the TCSF” which we believe is erroneous in certain key respects (on which we would be willing to elaborate if that would be helpful to the CMA).

constraint of Hitachi Rail in the UK. The remedy taker will be acquiring a business which has been established for over 100 years in the European signalling market, has more than 500 FTEs with substantial signalling, engineering and manufacturing experience and capability; and, crucially to the CMA's provisional theory of harm, a business which has experience of delivering mainline signalling projects for Network Rail. 11 The ORR’s “observations on behavioural remedies” therefore have no application in this case.

While the Parties take issue with certain aspects of the Submission, we are pleased to note that the Remedy Package is entirely consistent with the ORR's expectations for a suitable remedy proposal, affirming the robust nature of the Divestment Business, and its ability to replicate the competitive constraint of Hitachi Rail in the UK. The Parties are confident that the Divestment Business will be able to provide some of the additional capacity required by Network Rail to achieve the digitalisation of mainline signalling services.

Please let us know if it would be helpful for the Parties to elaborate further on any of the points made above.

Yours sincerely
