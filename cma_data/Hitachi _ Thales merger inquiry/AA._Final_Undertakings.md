# ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION BY HITACHI RAIL LIMITED OF THALES SA’s GROUND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS BUSINESS

Final Undertakings given by Hitachi Rail Limited to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 82 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Background

A. On 23 December 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), referred the anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail Limited ( Hitachi Rail ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hitachi Limited of the Ground Transportation Systems business (the Target ) (the Merger ) carried on by Thales SA ( Thales )(Hitachi and Thales together, the Parties ), for further investigation and report by a group of CMA panel members.

B. On 3 August 2023, the CMA accepted interim undertakings ( Interim Undertakings ) from Hitachi Rail pursuant to section 80 of the Act for the purpose of preventing pre-emptive action in accordance with that section. On 8 August 2023, the CMA issued written directions under the Interim Undertakings for the appointment of a monitoring trustee (the Monitoring Trustee ) in order to monitor and ensure Hitachi Rail’s compliance with the Interim Undertakings. C. The CMA published a final report pursuant to section 38 of the Act, titled ‘Anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail, Ltd of Thales SA's Ground transportation Systems Business’ (dated 4 October 2023) (the Report ) which concluded, among other things, that:

(a) the Merger may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) as a result of horizontal unilateral effects arising from overlaps between the Parties in the supply of digital mainline signalling systems and related services in Great Britain;

(b) the CMA should take action to remedy the SLC and any adverse effects resulting from it; and

(c) Hitachi Rail should divest its mainline signalling business in France, Germany and the UK (including staff, technology, and a production and

R&D site) as described in the Report and in Annex 1 (the Divestment Business ) (the Primary Divestiture Remedy ).

D. The implementation of the Primary Divestiture Remedy will be subject to the following safeguards:

(a) Hitachi Rail will be subject to regular reporting requirements in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 13;

(b) the Monitoring Trustee appointed in accordance with paragraph 9 will monitor compliance with these Final Undertakings, including the progress of the implementation of the Primary Divestiture Remedy;

(c) the appointment of a Hold Separate Manager;

(d) the purchaser of the Divestment Business must be an Approved Purchaser in accordance with the Purchaser Approval Criteria in Annex 2; and

(e) these Final Undertakings include provisions enabling the CMA to direct the appointment of a Divestiture Trustee to effect the final disposal of the Divestment Business in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 10.

E. The Report also provided that in the event that customer consent from each of Network Rail, SNCF and Deutsche Bahn to the transfer of their Backlog Contracts $\[{\\mathcal{Q}}\\ll\]$ to the Approved Purchaser is not obtained within the Divestiture Period, prohibition would be an effective and proportionate alternative remedy (the Alternative Remedy ).

F. On \[Date\], in anticipation of the Primary Divestiture Remedy, a Hold Separate Manager was appointed pursuant to written Directions issued by the CMA pursuant to paragraph 3.5 of the Interim Undertakings to hold the Divestment Business separate from Hitachi Rail and to manage the day-to-day business of the Divestment Business under the supervision of the Monitoring Trustee.

G. By virtue of section 80(8) of the Act, the Interim Undertakings cease to be in force on the date of acceptance by the CMA, pursuant to section 82 of the Act, of these Final Undertakings. To the extent applicable, any derogations already granted by the CMA pursuant to the Interim Undertakings shall remain applicable in the context of these Final Undertakings.

H. On \[Date\] the CMA accepted undertakings from Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi Rail and Thales under section 82 of the Act, in accordance with section 41 of the Act for the purpose of giving effect to the obligations of Hitachi, Ltd under the Primary Divestiture Remedy, and if necessary, giving effect to the Alternative Remedy in the event that the Primary Divestiture Remedy does not proceed due to the

failure to obtain the necessary customer consents within the time permitted (the Additional Final Undertakings ).

I. Now therefore, Hitachi Rail gives to the CMA on behalf of itself and, where relevant, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, the following undertakings under section 82 of the Act, in accordance with section 41 of the Act, for the purpose of giving effect to the Primary Divestiture Remedy.

# Annex 2

# Purchaser Approval Criteria

These Purchaser Approval Criteria are to be construed in a manner that is consistent with, and for the purpose of giving effect to, the Report.

The CMA shall on reasonable request give Hitachi Rail guidance on the interpretation of specific aspects of these Purchaser Approval Criteria, so as to enable Hitachi Rail to ensure that its selected purchaser for the Divestment Business will meet the requirements of this Annex.

In order for a Proposed Purchaser to be approved by the CMA, the CMA must be satisfied that the Proposed Purchaser:

(a) Is independent of the Parties. The Proposed Purchaser should have no significant connection to either Hitachi Rail or the Target that may compromise the purchaser’s incentives to compete with Hitachi Rail (for example, an equity interest, common significant shareholders, shared directors, material reciprocal trading relationships or continuing financial assistance).

# (b) Has the necessary capability to compete.

(i) The Proposed Purchaser must have access to appropriate financial resources, expertise (including managerial, operational and technical capability (including understanding of the regulatory regime)) and assets to enable the assets comprising the Divestment Business to be used to compete effectively in the market as part of a viable and active business. This should be sufficient to enable the purchaser of the Divestment Business to continue to develop as an effective competitor. (ii) The Proposed Purchaser should have the relevant experience either in the rail signalling sector or in adjacent markets (e.g., in the markets for rolling stock or CBTC).

(iii) The Proposed Purchaser should have sufficient financial resources to support the Divestment Business and $\[{\\mathcal{B}}\\ll\]$ .

(iv) The Proposed Purchaser should have the capabilities and attributes necessary to enable it to obtain the consents of the customers pursuant to paragraph 4.2.2 of the Final Undertakings. The CMA will engage with each of Network Rail, SNCF and Deutsche Bahn as soon as reasonably practicable on: (a) their views of each Proposed Purchaser’s prospects and likelihood of obtaining their final consents under their respective legal frameworks governing the transfer of contracts to the purchaser; and (b) the process that the relevant customer intends to follow in determining whether to grant such approval;

(v) The Proposed Purchaser must reasonably be expected to obtain all necessary approvals, licences and consents from any regulatory or other authority for the acquisition of the Divestment Business.

(c) Is committed to competing in the relevant market. The CMA will wish to be satisfied that the Proposed Purchaser has an appropriate business plan and objectives for competing in the relevant market and that the Proposed Purchaser has the incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Business as part of a viable and active business in competition with Hitachi Rail and other competitors in the market.

(d) That divestiture to the Proposed Purchaser will not create further competition concerns .

(i) Divestiture to the Proposed Purchaser should not create a realistic prospect of an SLC within any market in the UK. This is regardless of whether or not the transaction constitutes a relevant merger situation under the Act.

(ii) To the extent applicable, the CMA will have regard to the time required by the Proposed Purchaser to obtain approvals from competition authorities for its acquisition of the Divestment Business within the Divestiture Period.

(iii) The Proposed Purchaser shall not be Siemens or Alstom.
