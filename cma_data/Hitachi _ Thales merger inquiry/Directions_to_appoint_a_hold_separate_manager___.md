# ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION BY HITACHI RAIL, LTD OF THE GROUND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS BUSINESS CARRIED ONBY THALES SA

Directions issued pursuant to paragraph 3.5 of the Interim Undertakings accepted by the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 80 of the Enterprise Act 2002

On 23 December 2022, in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) referred the anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail Limited ( Hitachi Rail ) of the Ground Transportation Systems Business (the Target ) (the Merger ) carried on by Thales SA to its chair for the constitution of a group of CMA Panel Members (the Inquiry Group ) (the Reference ) to determine in accordance with section 36 of the Act:

a) whether arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation; and

b) if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.

On 3 August 2023, the CMA accepted interim undertakings ( Interim Undertakings )from Hitachi Rail Limited in relation to the Merger in accordance with section 80 of the Act to prevent pre-emptive action.

On 8 August 2023, the CMA issued written directions to Hitachi Rail to appoint a monitoring trustee ( Monitoring Trustee ) in order to monitor and ensure Hitachi Rail’s compliance with the Interim Undertakings.

The CMA published a final report pursuant to section 38 of the Act, titled ‘Anticipated acquisition by Hitachi Rail, Ltd of Thales SA's Ground Transportation Systems Business’ (dated 4 October 2023) (the Report ) which concluded, among other things, that:

a) the Merger may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition (SLC ) as a result of horizontal unilateral effects arising from overlaps between the Parties in the supply of digital mainline signalling systems and related services in Great Britain;

b) the CMA should take action to remedy the SLC and any adverse effects resulting from it;

c) Hitachi Rail should divest its mainline signalling businesses in France, Germany and the UK (including staff, technology, and a production and research and development ( R&D ) site) as described in the Report (the Divestment Business ) (the Primary Divestiture Remedy ).

The Report also provided that a Hold Separate Manager should be appointed to hold the Divestment Business separate from Hitachi Rail and to manage the day-to-day business of the Divestment Business. On 1 November 2023, Hitachi Rail appointed a Hold Separate Manager under commitments it has given to the European Commission.

In order to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of the Reference under section 22 of the Act which might prejudice that Reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA under Part 3 of the Act which might be justified by the CMA’s decision on the Reference, the CMA now issues written Directions under paragraph 3.5 of the Interim Undertakings that Hitachi Rail must appoint a Hold Separate Manager of the Divestment Business in accordance with the terms provided for, and must comply with the obligations set out, in Annex 1.
