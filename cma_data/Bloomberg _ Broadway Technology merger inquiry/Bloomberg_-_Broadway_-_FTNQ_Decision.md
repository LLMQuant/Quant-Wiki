# INTRODUCTION

1. On 16 February 2023, Bloomberg L.P. ( Bloomberg ) agreed to acquire Broadway Technology, LLC ( Broadway ) by way of purchase of the entire issued equity interests of Broadway. Bloomberg and Broadway are together referred to as the Parties .

2. On 19 July 2023, the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) gave notice to the Parties that the merger notice was complete and announced the launch of its merger inquiry.


# JURISDICTION

3. The UK turnover of Broadway did not exceed £70 million in the last financial year. Therefore, the turnover test in section 23(1)(b) of the Act is not met.

4. The Parties overlap in the supply of sell-side 2front-office 3systems for the electronic trading of fixed income securities 4(FI ) on a global basis, including in the UK.

5. The Parties submitted that they do not account for a share of supply in the UK of $25%$ or more and, accordingly, that the share of supply test in section 23(2)(b) of the Act is not met.

6. The CMA considered various descriptions of the services in respect of which the Parties overlap and various measures of share of supply, including that relied on by the CMA in ION/Broadway and requested relevant information from customers and competitors of the Parties. This analysis and testing found that the share of supply test was not met on any basis.

7. For these reasons, the CMA does not believe that the share of supply test in section 23(2)(b) of the Act is met.


# DECISION

8. On the basis of the information available to it, the CMA does not believe that it is or may be the case that arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation because neither the turnover test nor the share of supply test in section 23 of the Act is met. 9. The acquisition will therefore not be referred under section 33 of the Act.
