# Anticipated Acquisition by Hanson Quarry Products Europe Limited of Mick George Limited

NOTICE TO EXTEND UNDERTAKINGS IN LIEU OF REFERENCE PERIOD

ME/7034/22

# Notice of extension of the period mentioned in section 73A(3) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act) published pursuant to section 107(1)(eb) of the Act.

On 09 December 2023 the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) gave notice under section 73A(2)(b) of the Act that it was considering whether to accept the undertaking offered by Hanson Quarry Products Europe Limited and Mick George Limited (together, the Parties ).

Pursuant to section 73A(3) of the Act the CMA has until 7 February 2024 to decide whether to accept this undertaking. The CMA considers that this period should be extended under section 73A(4) of the Act, because it will not be possible to reach a decision on acceptance of the undertaking by 7 February 2024. The reason for this is that the undertaking involves an upfront buyer .Accordingly, the CMA considers that there are special reasons for the extension. The CMA also considers that this extension does not materially increase the risk of an anti-competitive outcome from the merger and that there is a sufficient likelihood that it will be able to accept the undertaking before the end of the extended period, given the significant steps which have been taken so far, including over the Christmas period.

This notice comes into force on the date of publication of this notice. The extension ends on 5 April 2024.
