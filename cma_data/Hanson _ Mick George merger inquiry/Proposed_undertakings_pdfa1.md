# CASE ME/ 7034/ 22

# ACQUISITION BY HANSON QUARRY PRODUCTS EUROPE LIMITED OF MICK GEORGE LIMITED

# Undertakings given by Hanson Quarry Products Europe Limited and Mick George Limited to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Whereas:

(a) Hanson Quarry Products Europe Limited (trading as Heidelberg Materials, HM ) agreed to purchase Mick George Limited ( MGL ) on 10 December 2022 by way of an acquisition by HM of $100%$ of the issued share capital of MGL (the Transaction ) such that HM and MGL will cease to be distinct for the purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act );

(b) Under section 22(1) of the Act the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA )has a duty to refer a relevant merger situation for a Phase 2 investigation where it believes that it is or may be the case that the creation of that merger situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or services;

(c) Under section 73 of the Act the CMA may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it, accept undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate, from such of the parties concerned as it considers appropriate. In particular, the CMA shall have regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(d) As set out in the CMA’s decision of 23 November 2023 (the Decision ), the CMA believes that, in the absence of appropriate undertakings, it would be under a duty to refer the Transaction for a Phase 2 investigation;

(e) The CMA considers that the undertakings given below by HM are appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from the Transaction, or may be expected to result from it, as specified in the Decision; and

(f) Prior to the acceptance of these undertakings by the CMA, HM entered into legally binding agreements of \[date\] to divest the Divestment Businesses as a going concern to two Proposed Purchasers on terms approved by the CMA. With the exception of certain third-party property consents which were brought to the attention of the CMA, these agreements were conditional only on formal CMA approval of the Proposed Purchasers and acceptance by the CMA of these undertakings. These agreements each include a warranty that the Proposed Purchasers have the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Businesses as part of a viable and active business in competition with HM and other competitors in the local areas in which the Divestment Businesses are active.

NOW THEREFORE HM and MGL hereby give to the CMA the following undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it.

# 1EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE UNDERTAKINGS

1.1 These undertakings shall take effect from the date that, having been signed by HM and MGL, they are accepted by the CMA.

# 2DIVESTMENT OF THE DIVESTMENT BUSINESSES

2.1 HM and MGL shall ensure that the completion of the divestment of the Divestment Businesses to the Proposed Purchasers contemplated by the agreements referred to in recital (f) of these undertakings takes place within a period not exceeding one month from the date these undertakings take effect.

2.2 HM and MGL shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure the transfer of Key Staff required by the Proposed Purchasers for the operation of the Divestment Businesses with the divestment of the Divestment Businesses. 2.3 Where HM or MGL divests a Divestment Business over which it holds, or MGL holds, a freehold interest by way of the grant of a long lease on normal commercial terms of not less than 25 years duration to the Proposed Purchasers, it shall in addition sell the freehold interest in the Divestment Business to a person independent of and unconnected to HM and the Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate to which HM belongs and any Associated Person or Affiliate of HM or such Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate, within a period not exceeding three months from the date of the commencement of the lease.

2.4 In the event that HM or MGL fails to complete the divestment of the Divestment Businesses in accordance with paragraphs 2.1,2.2 and 2.3 above, the CMA may, whether or not initiating the Trustee Functions as set out in paragraph 4 below, require HM or MGL to divest the Divestment Businesses as a going concern at no minimum price to a purchaser or purchasers approved by the CMA.

# 3APPROVAL OF PURCHASER AND TERMS OF DIVESTMENT

3.1 For the purposes of the CMA approving the Proposed Purchasers and the terms of the divestment of the relevant Divestment Businesses to the Proposed Purchasers in accordance with these undertakings, HM or MGL shall, save as required or permitted by the CMA, satisfy the CMA that:

(a) the acquisition by the Proposed Purchasers of the Divestment Businesses, on the terms set out above, remedies, mitigates or prevents the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it, or may be expected to result from it, in particular having regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(b) each Proposed Purchaser is independent of and unconnected to HM and the Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate to which HM belongs and any Associated Person or Affiliate of HM or such Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate;

(c) each Proposed Purchaser has the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Business which it is proposing to purchase as a viable and active business in competition with HM and other competitors in the markets for the supply of: (i) non-specialist aggregates; and (ii) ready mix concrete ( RMX ) (as applicable) from the date of completion of the divestment of the Divestment Business;

(d) each Proposed Purchaser is reasonably to be expected to obtain all necessary approvals, licences and consents from any regulatory or other authority, including (where applicable) landlord’s consent to the transfer of any leasehold interest; and

(e) the acquisition by each Proposed Purchaser of the Divestment Business which it is proposing to purchase does not create a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK.
