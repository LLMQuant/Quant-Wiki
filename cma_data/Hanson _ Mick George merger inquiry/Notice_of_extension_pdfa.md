# Anticipated acquisition by Hanson Quarry Products Europe Limited of Mick George Limited

NOTICE OF EXTENSION OF THE INITIAL PERIOD MENTIONED IN SECTION 34ZA(1) OF THE ENTERPRISE ACT 2002 (THE ACT) PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 107(1)(AC) OF THE ACT.

24 October 2023

On 19 September 2023 the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) gave notice under section 34ZA(3) of the Act that the initial period in relation to the anticipated acquisition by Hanson Quarry Products Europe Limited ( Hanson ) of Mick George Limited ( MGL ) had commenced.

On 23 October 2023 the CMA issued a notice to MGL under section 109 of the Act requiring the provision of certain information and documents by 3.30pm on 24 October (the Notice ). The information and documents required have not been provided to the satisfaction of the CMA. MGL has, therefore, failed (with or without a reasonable excuse) to comply with a requirement of a notice under section 109 of the Act.

Accordingly, the CMA has decided that, pursuant to section 34ZB(1) of the Act, the initial period should be extended until MGL provides the information and documents to the satisfaction of the CMA as required by the Notice or the CMA cancels this extension.

The extension comes into force on the date of publication of this notice.
