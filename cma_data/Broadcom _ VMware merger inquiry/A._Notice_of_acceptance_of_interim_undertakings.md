# REFERENCE RELATING TO THE ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION BY BROADCOM INC OF VMWARE, INC

Notice of acceptance of interim undertakings pursuant to section 80 of the Enterprise Act 2002

On 29 March 2023, pursuant to section 33(1) and in accordance with section 34ZA(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), the CMA referred the acquisition of VMware, Inc by Broadcom Inc (the Merger ) to its chair for the constitution of a group (the Group ) under Schedule 4 to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 to conduct a Phase 2 investigation to consider, pursuant to section 36(1) of the Act, whether arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation; and if so, whether this may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK (the Reference ).

The CMA wishes to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of the Reference which might prejudice the Reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA under Part 3 of the Act which might be justified by the CMA’s decisions on the Reference.

Now, pursuant to section 80(2) of the Act, for the purpose of preventing pre-emptive action, as defined by section 80(10) of the Act, the CMA accepts Interim Undertakings from each of Broadcom and VMware as set out in the Annex below, and accordingly these Interim Undertakings came into force pursuant to section 80(5) of the Act with immediate effect.
