# COMPLETED ACQUISITION BY COPART, INC. OF GREEN PARTS SPECIALIST HOLDINGS LTD

Initial Enforcement Order made by the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act)

Whereas:

(a) the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is or may be the case that Copart, Inc. ( Copart ) and Green Parts Specialist Holdings Ltd ( Hills Motors ) (whose subsidiaries include Green Parts Salvage & Recycling Ltd, formerly named Hill’s Salvage & Recycling Ltd) have ceased to be distinct;

(b) the CMA is considering, pursuant to section 22 of the Act, whether it is or may be the case that a relevant merger situation has been created and whether the creation of that situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in any market or markets in the United Kingdom ( UK );

(c) the CMA wishes to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of any reference under section 22 of the Act which might prejudice that reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA under Part 3 of the Act which might be justified by the CMA’s decisions on the reference; and

(d) the circumstances set out in section 72(6) of the Act do not apply and the reference has not been finally determined in accordance with section 79(1) of the Act.

Now for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action in accordance with section 72(2) of the Act the CMA makes the following order addressed to Copart, CPRT LLP (Copart UK Topco ), Copart UK Limited ( Copart UK ) and Hills Motors (together the Addressees ) ( Order ).

# Commencement, application and scope

1. This Order commences on the commencement date: 9 August 2022. 2. This Order applies to each of the Addressees. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Order, no act or omission shall constitute a breach of this Order, and nothing in this Order shall oblige any of the Addressees to reverse any act or omission, in each case to the extent that it occurred or was completed prior to the commencement date.

# Management of the Copart and Hills Motors businesses until determination of proceedings

4. Except with the prior written consent of the CMA, each of the Addressees shall not, during the specified period, take any action which might prejudice a reference of the transaction under section 22 of the Act or impede the taking of any action under the Act by the CMA which may be justified by the CMA’s decisions on such a reference, including any action which might:

(a) lead to the integration of the Hills Motors business with the Copart business;

(b) transfer the ownership or control of the Copart business or the Hills Motors business or any of their subsidiaries; or

(c) otherwise impair the ability of the Hills Motors business or the Copart business to compete independently in any of the markets affected by the transaction.

5. Further and without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 4 and subject to paragraph 3, each of the Addressees shall at all times during the specified period take all necessary steps to ensure that, except with the prior written consent of the CMA:

(a) the Hills Motors business is carried on separately from the Copart business and the Hills Motors business’s separate sales or brand identity is maintained;

(b) the Hills Motors business and the Copart business are maintained as a going concern and sufficient resources are made available for the development of the Hills Motors business and the Copart business, on the basis of their respective pre-merger business plans;

(c) except in the ordinary course of business, no significant changes are made to the organisational structure of, or the management responsibilities within, the Hills Motors business or the Copart business;

(f) there is no integration of the information technology of the Hills Motors or Copart businesses, and the software and hardware platforms of the Hills Motors business shall remain essentially unchanged, except for routine changes and maintenance;

(g) the customer and supplier lists of the two businesses shall be operated and updated separately and any negotiations with any existing or potential customers and suppliers in relation to the Hills Motors business will be carried out by the Hills Motors business alone and for the avoidance of doubt the Copart business will not negotiate on behalf of the Hills Motors business (and vice versa) or enter into any joint agreements with the Hills Motors business (and vice versa);

of its employees, directors, agents or affiliates), or vice versa, except where strictly necessary in the ordinary course of business (including, for example, where required for compliance with external regulatory or accounting obligations or for due diligence, integration planning or the completion of any merger control proceedings relating to the transaction) and on the basis that, should the transaction be prohibited, any records or copies (electronic or otherwise) of such information that have passed, wherever they may be held, will be returned to the business to which they relate and any copies destroyed.
