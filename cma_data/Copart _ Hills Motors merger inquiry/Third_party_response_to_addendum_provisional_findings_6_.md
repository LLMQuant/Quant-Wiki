# Third party response to provisional findings

Very surprised at the significant U turn in the CMA decision. I think the Purchase of Hills salvage was never about Hills being in Competition with Copart as clearly Hills are not in the same league as Copart it was far more about the doors it opened for Copart regarding green parts and the links to insures this provides.

I would suggest following this merger news at least one business ( sure trac ) will almost certainly lose their existing contract with Tescoâ€™s to Copart ( Suretrac currently use a national independent network of salvage operators ) and therefore no longer exist creating even less competition in the market . Ageas who have been waiting on the side lines will now have to decide what to do. if this works moves from Hills to Copart the work will no longer be shared with the current network of members it will be serviced through Copart again reducing competition.

These again are some immediate concerns not to mention the $25%$ of business E2E is about to lose to Copart due to the Purchase of Hills recycling.

This merger can only be seen to strangle competition not create it.
