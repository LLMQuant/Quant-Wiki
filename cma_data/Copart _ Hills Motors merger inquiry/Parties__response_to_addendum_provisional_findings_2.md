# Third party response to provisional findings

I think I speak on behalf of all independent vehicle recyclers throughout the country when I say this but our concern has never been the lessening of salvager opƟons for the insurance industry, it has always been the fact that Copart can lessen the availability of good quality cat b cars from aucƟon. What this merger will now do is enable the same to happen as what we have just seen at IAA where cat B’s are now broken in house. A lot of businesses, some may have been run for generaƟons, will decide to close or be forced to. It will be a sad day for those that do. This is always been my concern, nothing else.
