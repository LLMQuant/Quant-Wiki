# Appendix B: Conduct of the inquiry

01. On 9 December 2022 the CMA referred the completed acquisition by Copart UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Copart, Inc. ( Copart ) of the entire issued share capital of Green Parts Specialist Holdings Ltd (formerly named ILT Project Limited) ( Hills Motors )1for an in-depth phase 2 investigation.

02. We published the biographies of the members of the Inquiry Group conducting the phase 2 inquiry on the inquiry webpage on 9 December 2022 and the administrative timetable for the inquiry was published on the inquiry webpage on 22 December 2022.

03. We invited a wide range of interested parties to comment on the Merger. We gathered evidence from customers and competitors via written questionnaires and video conference calls in order to better understand the markets and obtain their views on the potential impact of the Merger on competition. This included evidence from 18 competitors in salvaging and dismantling and 19 customers of salvage services (of which the majority were insurance companies). As part of this evidence gathering, we requested and reviewed contemporaneous internal documents from customers who had conducted recent benchmarking and tender processes to which the Parties had been invited. We also received input from other industry associations and players. Evidence submitted during the CMA’s phase 1 investigation was also considered in phase 2.

04. On 13 January 2023, we published our issues statement on the inquiry webpage setting out the areas of concern on which the inquiry would focus. 5. We received written evidence from the Parties in the form of submissions and responses to information requests, including a substantial volume of internal documents from the Parties. The Parties’ response to the Phase 1 Decision and response the Issues Statement were published on the inquiry webpage on 23 March 2023.

05. On 16 January 2023 and 19 January 2023 members of the Inquiry Group, accompanied by CMA staff, visited Copart and Hills Motors offices respectively.

06. On 18 January 2023, we directed the Parties to appoint a Monitoring Trustee. The directions to appoint a Monitoring Trustee were published on the inquiry webpage on 20 January 2023.

07. During our inquiry, we sent the Parties working papers for comment. We also provided the Parties and third parties with extracts from our working papers for comments on accuracy and confidentiality. The Parties were also sent an annotated Issues Statement (the AIS ), which outlined our thinking prior to their respective hearings. The Parties provided comments on our annotated Issues Statement and working papers on 14 March 2023 and supplementary submissions on 14, 15 and 23 March 2023.

08. We held separate hearings with the Parties on 10 March 2023. 10. On 6 April 2023, we published a notice of extension on the inquiry webpage setting out the Inquiry Group’s decision to extend the reference period of the inquiry. A revised version of the administrative timetable was also published on the inquiry webpage . In taking this decision, the Inquiry Group had regard to the need to consider the issues raised and additional evidence (including survey and witness evidence) submitted by the Parties in their response to the AIS and working papers (the Response ), the need to gather and analyse further evidence from third parties following the Response, and the time needed to prepare and consult on provisional findings whilst allowing sufficient time to prepare a fully reasoned final report in the statutory timeframe. This changed the statutory deadline to 20 July 2023.

09. On 5 May 2023, we published a notice of provisional findings, a summary of our provisional findings report and a non-confidential version of our provisional findings report on the inquiry webpage . As we had provisionally concluded that the completed acquisition of Hills Motors by Copart had resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation ( RMS ), and the creation of that RMS has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) in the market for the supply of salvage services in the UK due to horizontal unilateral effects, a notice of possible remedies ( Remedies Notice ) was also published on the inquiry webpage .Non-confidential versions of responses to our provisional findings have been published on the inquiry webpage .

10. We held separate response hearings with the Parties on 5 June 2023. We sent the Parties a Remedies Working Paper ( RWP ) on 14 June 2023 for comment.

11. On 23 June 2023, we published a notice of addendum provisional findings and a non-confidential version of our addendum provisional findings report on the inquiry webpage . A revised version of the administrative timetable was also published on the inquiry webpage . Non-confidential versions of responses to our addendum provisional findings have been published on the inquiry webpage .

12. A non-confidential version of our final report has been published on the inquiry webpage .

13. We would like to thank all those who have assisted in our inquiry.
