Whereas:

(a) on 21 July 2023, the CMA issued a decision finding that it is or may be the case that arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in LKQ and Uni-Select ceasing to be distinct (the Transaction), and that this may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in certain markets in the United Kingdom;

(b) on 21 July 2023, LKQ offered undertakings in lieu of reference to the CMA for the purposes of section 73(2) of the Act;

(c) on 28 July 2023, the CMA gave notice pursuant to section 73A(2)(b) of the Act, that it considered that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the undertakings offered, or a modified version of them, might be accepted by the CMA under section 73(2) of the Act;

(d) the CMA has until 2 October 2023 pursuant to section 73A(3) of the Act to decide whether to accept the undertakings with the possibility to extend this timeframe pursuant to section 73A(4) of the Act to 27 November 2023 if it considers that there are special reasons for doing so;

(e) if no undertakings are accepted, the CMA will refer the Transaction for a phase 2 investigation pursuant to sections 22(1) or 33(1) and 34ZA(2) of the

Act which might be justified by the CMA's decisions on the reference;

(g) in the particular circumstances of this investigation, the CMA has decided it is willing to impose a tailored IEO (as provided for in paragraphs 2.33 to 2.37 of its guidance CMA1o8: Interim measures in merger investigations); and

(h) the circumstances set out in section 72(6) of the Act do not apply and the reference has not been finally determined in accordance with section 79(1) of the Act.
