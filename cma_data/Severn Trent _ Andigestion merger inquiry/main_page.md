### Invitation to comment: Closed on 03 July 2023
19 June 2023: The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.
To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments on the transaction from any interested party, in advance of the CMA’s formal investigation starting.
These comments should be provided by the deadline set out above.
