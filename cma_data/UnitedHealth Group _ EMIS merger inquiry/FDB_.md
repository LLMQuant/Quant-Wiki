FDB submits this Response to the Provisional Findings published 11 August 2023 (“PFs”) in connection with the proposed acquisition by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated of EMIS Group Plc (“Proposed Transaction”).

Overall FDB was surprised by the PFs, because they represented a substantial change from the Phase 1 Decision. Given the reasoned submissions and the strength of the evidence FDB has provided regarding the potential adverse impact on competition of the Proposed Transaction during its engagement with the CMA $\\mathcal{Q}\\llcorner$ , FDB was surprised both at the conclusion the CMA has reached and that there was no indication of the CMA's changing views prior to publication of the PFs.

In particular, FDB was disappointed not to have an opportunity to engage with new arguments made by the Parties and new submissions from third parties, upon which the CMA has relied in its PFs. Whilst acknowledging confidentiality, FDB also considers that it should have had an opportunity to engage with the economic analysis at least at a summary level on the basis this pertains to loss of revenue suffered by FDB.

FDB has two central concerns about the CMA's PFs. First, the CMA's contention that the NHS would be able to discipline the behaviour of the Merged Entity if it tried to foreclose FDB or other third-party suppliers. As we outline below, FDB considers that this is simply not the case. In particular FDB notes that there are contradictions between the CMA's findings on the ability and incentive of the Merged Entity to foreclose third party suppliers. Second, FDB remains very concerned about the Merged Entity's access to FDB's competitively sensitive information. This information is competitively sensitive as we have explained and FDB has no choice but to share this information with EMIS in practice. We address these points in more detail below.

FDB would welcome the opportunity to discuss the content contained herein with the CMA and assist the CMA further in the process.
