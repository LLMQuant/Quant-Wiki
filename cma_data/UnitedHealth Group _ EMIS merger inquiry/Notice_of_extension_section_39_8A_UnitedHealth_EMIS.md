# REFERENCE RELATING TO THE ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION BY UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED OF EMIS GROUP PLC

# Notice of extension of inquiry period under section 39(8A) of the Enterprise Act 2002 1

1. On 31 March 2023, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act), made a reference to its Chair for the constitution of a Group of CMA Panel Members to conduct a phase 2 investigation into the anticipated acquisition by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated of EMIS Group Plc (together the Parties). The period within which the report on this reference was to be prepared and published under section 39(1) of the Act (the reference period) was due to expire on 14 September 2023.

2. On 3 April 2023, the Parties made a request to the CMA in accordance with section 39(8A) of the Act for a specified period of three weeks to be disregarded for the purposes of determining the reference period, as the Parties were considering their next steps, including whether to continue with the arrangements which are the subject of the reference or whether to abandon those arrangements.

3. The CMA considered the request and reasonably believes that the arrangements in question might be abandoned.

4. Accordingly, the CMA has decided, pursuant to section 39(8A) of the Act, that a period of three weeks is to be disregarded for the purposes of determining the reference period and the reference period will therefore expire on 5 October 2023.
