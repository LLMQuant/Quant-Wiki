Notice of provisional findings made under Rule 11.3 of the Competition and Markets Authority Rules of Procedure 11. On 31 March 2023, the Competition and Markets Authority (the CMA ), in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), made a reference to its chair for the constitution of a Group of CMA Panel Members (the Inquiry Group )2regarding the anticipated acquisition by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated ( UH ) of EMIS Group Plc ( EMIS ) (the Merger ) for further investigation and requiring it to report within a period ending on 14 September 2023. The CMA subsequently decided, pursuant to section 39(8A) of the Act, to disregard a period of three weeks for the purposes of determining the reference period such that the reference period is due to expire on 5 October 2023.

Provisional findings

2. The Inquiry Group appointed to consider this reference has made the following provisional findings on the statutory questions it has to decide pursuant to section 36(1) of the Act:

(a) arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation; and

(b) the creation of that situation may not be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.

3. The Inquiry Groupâ€™s reasons are set out in full in the provisional findings report, which is attached to this notice, and are summarised in the summary of the provisional findings report (see note below).

The next steps

4. Anyone wishing to comment on the provisional findings is now invited to provide the Inquiry Group with their reasons in writing as to why these provisional findings should not become final (or, as the case may be, should be varied).
5. These reasons should be received by the Inquiry Group no later than 17:00 (UK time) on Friday 1 September 2023 . For comments submitted by email, these should be sent to [unitedhealth.emis@cma.gov.uk](mailto:unitedhealth.emis@cma.gov.uk) .
6. The Inquiry Group will have regard to any such reasons in making its final decisions on the statutory questions and actions. However, the Inquiry Group shall not be obliged to take into account reasons which are provided after the deadline specified in paragraph 5.
