# ACQUISITION BY BESTWAY PANACEA HOLDINGS LIMITED OF LEXON UK HOLDINGS LIMITED AND ASUREX LIMITED

Initial Enforcement Order made by the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act)

# Whereas:

(a) the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is or may be the case that arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in Bestway Panacea Holdings Limited ( Well ) and Lexon UK Holdings Limited ( Lexon ) and Asurex Limited ( Asurex ) ceasing to be distinct;

(b) the CMA is considering whether to make a reference under section 22 or 33 of the Act;

(c) Well is a private limited liability company, which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Bestway Healthcare Finco Limited a private limited company (Bestway Finco ) which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Bestway Healthcare Holdings Limited ( Bestway Healthcare ), a private limited Company;

(d) Lexon is a private limited company which controls the relevant businesses that have been carved out from Kericho Holding Limited’s ( Kericho’s )retained corporate group. Kericho is a private limited liability company and Lexon is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kericho. Lexon owns and manages the relevant contracts, employees, intellectual property rights and goodwill assets which are necessary to operate the business of Lexon;

(e) Norchem Healthcare Limited is a private limited company which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Lexon ( Norchem ). Norchem owns and operates retail pharmacy businesses that have been carved out from Kericho’s retained corporate group;

(f) the CMA wishes to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of any reference under sections 22 or 33 of the Act which might prejudice that

reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA under Part 3 of the Act which might be justified by the CMA’s decisions on the reference; and (g) the circumstances set out in section 72(6) of the Act do not apply and the reference has not been finally determined in accordance with section 79(1) of the Act.
