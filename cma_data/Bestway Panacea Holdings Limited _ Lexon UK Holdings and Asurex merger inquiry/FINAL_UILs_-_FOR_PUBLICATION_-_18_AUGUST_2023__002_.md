# UNDERTAKINGS IN LIEU OF A REFERENCE

COMPLETED ACQUISITION BY BESTWAY PANACEA HOLDINGS LIMITED OF LEXON UK HOLDINGS LIMITED AND ASUREX LIMITED

# Undertakings given by Bestway Panacea Holdings Limited to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Whereas:

(a) Bestway Panacea Holdings Limited ( Well or Buyer ) completed the acquisition of Lexon UK Holdings Limited ( Lexon ) and Asurex Limited (Asurex, each a Target and together the Targets ) on 14 April 2023 by way of a share purchase agreement (the Transaction ) such that Well and the Targets ceased to be distinct for the purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act );

(b) In its decision of 15 June 2023 (the Decision ), the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) decided under section 22(1) of the Act that the Transaction will give rise to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition (SLC ) in the operation of retail pharmacies in certain local areas in the UK. The CMA did not find competition concerns in relation to any of the other local area overlaps;

(c) Under section 22(1) of the Act the CMA has a duty to refer a relevant merger situation for a Phase 2 investigation where it believes that it is or may be the case that the creation of that merger situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or services;

(d) Under section 73 of the Act the CMA may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it, accept undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate, from such of the parties

concerned as it considers appropriate. In particular, the CMA shall have regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(e) As set out in the Decision, the CMA believes that, in the absence of appropriate undertakings, it would be under a duty to refer the Transaction for a Phase 2 investigation;

(f) The CMA considers that the undertakings given below by Well are appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from the Transaction, or may be expected to result from it, as specified in the Decision;

(g) Prior to the acceptance of these undertakings by the CMA, Well entered into legally binding agreements of 17 August 2023 to divest the Divestment Pharmacies as a going concern to Proposed Purchasers on terms approved by the CMA. These agreements were conditional on formal CMA approval of the Proposed Purchasers, acceptance by the CMA of these undertakings and the Proposed Purchasers obtaining Regulatory Approval (as defined in the undertakings). These agreements include a warranty that the Proposed Purchasers have the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Pharmacies as part of a viable and active business in competition with Well and other competitors in the operation of retail pharmacies in certain local areas in the UK; and

(h) The CMA made an Initial Enforcement Order applying to Bestway Healthcare Holdings Limited, Bestway Healthcare Finco Limited, Well, Kericho Holding Limited, Lexon and Norchem Healthcare Limited on 14 April 2023 in respect of the Transaction pursuant to section 72 of the Act for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action. Pursuant to section 72(6)(b) of the Act, this Initial Enforcement Order ceases to be in force on the acceptance by the CMA of the undertakings given below by Well.

NOW THEREFORE Well hereby gives to the CMA the following undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it.

1.1 These undertakings shall take effect from the date that, having been signed by Well, they are accepted by the CMA.

# 2DIVESTMENT OF THE DIVESTMENT PHARMACIES

2.1 Well shall ensure that the completion of the divestment of the Divestment Pharmacies to the Proposed Purchasers contemplated by the agreements referred to in recital g of these undertakings takes place within a period not exceeding 6 months from the date these undertakings take effect.

2.2 Well shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure the transfer of Key Staff with the divestment of the Divestment Pharmacies.

2.3 In the event that Well fails to complete the divestment of the Divestment Pharmacies in accordance with paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 above, the CMA may, whether or not initiating the Divestiture Trustee Functions as set out in paragraph 9 below, require Well to divest the Divestment Pharmacies as a going concern at no minimum price to a purchaser or purchasers approved by the CMA.

2.4 The CMA has approved the divestment of the Divestment Pharmacies to the Proposed Purchasers in the expectation that the Proposed Purchasers will obtain Regulatory Approval and Well shall use all reasonable endeavours to assist the Proposed Purchasers to obtain Regulatory Approval. In the event that Regulatory Approval is not obtained by the Proposed Purchasers within 6 months from the date these undertakings take effect, or where the CMA has reasonable grounds for believing that the Proposed Purchasers may not obtain Regulatory Approval, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2.3 above, the CMA may:

(a) Direct Well to divest the Divestment Pharmacies to an alternative purchaser or purchasers that will first be approved by the CMA; or

(b) Initiate the Divestiture Trustee Functions as set out in paragraph 9 below to require Well to divest the Divestment Pharmacies as a going concern at no minimum price to a purchaser or purchasers approved by the CMA.

# 3APPROVAL OF PURCHASERS AND TERMS OF DIVESTMENT

3.1 For the purposes of the CMA approving Proposed Purchasers and the terms of the divestment of the Divestment Pharmacies in accordance with these

undertakings, Well shall, save as required or permitted by the CMA, satisfy the CMA that:

(a) The acquisition by the Proposed Purchasers of the Divestment Pharmacies, on the terms set out above, remedies, mitigates or prevents the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it, or may be expected to result from it, in particular having regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(b) The Proposed Purchasers are independent of and unconnected to Well and the Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate to which Well belongs and any Associated Person or Affiliate of Well or such Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate;

(c) The Proposed Purchasers have the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Pharmacies as viable and active businesses in competition with Well and other competitors in the operation of retail pharmacies in certain local areas in the UK from the date of completion of the divestment of the Divestment Pharmacies;

(d) The Proposed Purchasers are reasonably to be expected to obtain all necessary approvals including Regulatory Approval, licences and consents from any regulatory or other authority, including (where applicable) landlord’s consent to the transfer of any leasehold interest; and

(e) The acquisition by the Proposed Purchasers of the Divestment Pharmacies does not create a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK.

3.2 The CMA may require Well to provide it with such information and documentation as it may reasonably require to satisfy the CMA that the Proposed Purchasers will fulfil the requirements in paragraph 3.1 above.
