### Invitation to comment: closed
24 April 2024: The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that Microsoft’s partnership with Mistral AI has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.
To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments from any interested party.
These comments should be provided by the deadline set out above.
