Initial Enforcement Order made by the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act)

Whereas:

(a) the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is or may be the case that arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in Theramex HQ UK Limited (Theramex ) and certain rights, assets and title to commercialise certain pharmaceutical products in the UK, the EEA, Switzerland, $\\mathcal{Y}\\ll$ (the Assets ), ceasing to be distinct;

(b) the CMA is considering whether to make a reference under section 22 or 33 of the Act;

(c) the CMA wishes to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of any reference under sections 22 or 33 of the Act which might prejudice that reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA under Part 3 of the Act which might be justified by the CMA’s decisions on the reference; and

(d) the circumstances set out in section 72(6) of the Act do not apply and the reference has not been finally determined in accordance with section 79(1) of the Act.

Now for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action in accordance with section 72(2) of the Act the CMA makes the following order addressed to CEP V Investment 25 S.à.r.l., CIM Europe S.à.r.l., Galaxy Acquisitions S.à.r.l., PAI Partners S.à.r.l., Theramex (referred to together as the Acquirer Group) and Viatris Inc ( Viatris ) ( Order ).
