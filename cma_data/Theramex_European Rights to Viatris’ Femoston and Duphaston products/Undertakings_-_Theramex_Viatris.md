# ACQUISITION BY THERAMEX OF THE EUROPEAN RIGHTS TO VIATRIS’ FEMOSTON AND DUPHASTON PRODUCTS

Undertakings given by Theramex and Viatris to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Whereas:

(a) Theramex HQ UK Limited ( Theramex ) anticipated the acquisition of the rights to Viatris Inc’s ( Viatris ) Femoston and Duphaston products (the Rights ) on 20 August 2023 by way of an asset purchase agreement, and as varied in the Letter Agreement executed by Theramex and Viatris dated 30 October 2023 (the APA and holistically, the Anticipated Transaction ) such that Theramex and the Rights would cease to be distinct for the purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act );

(b) Under section 33(1) of the Act the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA )has a duty to refer a relevant merger situation for a Phase 2 investigation where it believes that it is or may be the case that the creation of that merger situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or services;

(c) Under section 73 of the Act the CMA may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it, accept undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate, from such of the parties concerned as it considers appropriate. In particular, the CMA shall have regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(d) As set out in the CMA’s decision of 4 April 2024 (the Decision ), the CMA believes that, in the absence of appropriate undertakings, it would be under a duty to refer the Anticipated Transaction for a Phase 2 investigation;

(e) The CMA considers that the undertakings given below by Theramex and Viatris (together, the Parties and each a Party ) are appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from the Anticipated Transaction, or may be expected to result from it, as specified in the Decision;

(f) Prior to the acceptance of these undertakings by the CMA, Viatris entered into a legally binding agreement of 12 August 2024 to divest to a Proposed Purchaser a package containing the assets reasonably required for the Proposed Purchaser to (i) commercialise Femoston in the UK and (ii) re-apply for a marketing authorisation in the UK with a view to attempting to subsequently commercialise Duphaston in the UK (the Assets ) on terms agreed by the Parties and approved by the CMA. The full list of the Assets, which will be transferred to the Proposed Purchaser, is provided at Annex 1. (g) This agreement was conditional on formal CMA approval of the Proposed Purchaser and acceptance by the CMA of these undertakings. This agreement includes a warranty that the Proposed Purchaser has the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention (insofar as it is deemed commercially viable) to (i) maintain and operate the Assets with respect to Femoston as part of a viable and active business in competition with Theramex and other competitors in the supply of systemic hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) and (ii) attempt to launch Duphaston in the UK ; and

(h) The CMA made an Initial Enforcement Order applying to CEP V Investment 25 S.à.r.l., CIM Europe S.à.r.l., Galaxy Acquisitions S.à.r.l., PAI Partners S.à.r.l. and Theramex, and Viatris on 20 November 2023 in respect of the Anticipated Transaction pursuant to section 72 of the Act for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action, as varied on 20 November 2023, 26 March 2024 and 4 April 2024. Pursuant to section 72(6)(b) of the Act, this Initial Enforcement Order ceases to be in force on the acceptance by the CMA of the undertakings given below by the Parties.

NOW THEREFORE the Parties hereby give to the CMA the following undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it.
