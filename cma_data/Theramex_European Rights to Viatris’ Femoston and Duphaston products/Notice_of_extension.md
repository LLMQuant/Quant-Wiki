# ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION BY THERAMEX HQ UK LIMITED OF THE EUROPEAN RIGHTS TO VIATRIS INCâ€™S FEMOSTON AND DUPHASTON PRODUCTS

NOTICE TO EXTEND UNDERTAKINGS IN LIEU OF REFERENCE PERIOD

ME/7073/23

# Notice of extension of the period mentioned in section 73A(3) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act) published pursuant to section 107(1)(eb) of the Act.

On 18 April 2024 the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) gave notice under section 73A(2)(b) of the Act that it was considering whether to accept the undertaking offered by Theramex HQ UK Limited and Viatris Inc.

Pursuant to section 73A(3) of the Act the CMA has until 17 June 2024 to decide whether to accept this undertaking. The CMA considers that this period should be extended under section 73A(4) of the Act, because it was not possible to reach a decision on acceptance of the undertaking by 17 June 2024. The reason for this is that the undertaking involves an upfront buyer and requires material engagement with third parties .Accordingly, the CMA considers that there are special reasons for the extension. The CMA also considers that this extension does not materially increase the risk of an anti-competitive outcome from the merger and that there is a sufficient likelihood that it will be able to accept the undertaking before the end of the extended period.

This notice comes into force on the date of publication of this notice. The extension ends on 12 August 2024.
