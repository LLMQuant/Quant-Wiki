Please note that $\[\\mathcal{J}<\]$ indicates figures or text which have been deleted or replaced in ranges at the request of the parties for reasons of commercial confidentiality.

# Whereas

(a) On 10 January 2024 Pennon acquired $100%$ of the issued and to be issued share capital of SOGWUK (the “ Transaction ”), the subsidiaries of which include SES;

(b) Under section 32(b) of the Water Industry Act 1991 (as amended by the Water Act 2014) (“ WIA91 ”), the CMA has a duty to refer for a Phase 2 investigation where it believes that it is or may be the case that a merger of two or more water enterprises has taken place, unless it appears to the CMA that:

(c) Under section 33D of the WIA91, the CMA may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the prejudicial effect on Ofwat’s ability, in carrying out its functions, to make comparisons between water enterprises, which the Transaction has had, may have had or may be likely to have, accept undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate, from such of the parties concerned, as it considers appropriate. In particular, the CMA shall have regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the prejudicial effect on Ofwat’s ability, in carrying out its functions, to make comparisons between water enterprises;

(d) As set out in the CMA’s decision of 3 May 2024 (the “ Decision ”), the CMA believes that, in the absence of appropriate undertakings, it would be under a duty to refer the Transaction for a Phase 2 investigation;

(e) The CMA considers that the undertakings given below by Pennon are appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the prejudicial effect on Ofwat’s ability, in carrying out its functions, to make comparisons between water enterprises, which the Transaction has had, may have had or may be likely to have, as specified in the Decision;

(f) The CMA made an Initial Enforcement Order on 8 January 2024 and a Variation Order on 26 January 2024 applying to Pennon and SOGWUK in respect of the Transaction pursuant to section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action. Part 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (subject to modifications), including the CMA’s power to make an initial enforcement order under section 72(2), applies to mergers between water enterprises and references under section 32 of the WIA91 pursuant to regulation 2 of the Water Mergers (Modification of Enactments) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/3202, as amended); and

(g) Pursuant to section 72(6)(b) of the Enterprise Act 2002, the Initial Enforcement Order and the Variation Order cease to be in force on the acceptance by the CMA of the undertakings given below by Pennon.

Now therefore Pennon hereby gives to the CMA the following undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the prejudicial effect on Ofwat’s ability, in carrying out its functions, to make comparisons between water enterprises, which the Transaction has had, may have had or may be likely to have.

# 1Effective Date of the Undertakings

1.1 These undertakings shall take effect from the date that, having been signed by Pennon, they are accepted by the CMA.

# 2Undertakings

2.1 Nothing in these undertakings shall have the effect of varying, superseding or releasing any of the undertakings given by Pennon and accepted by the CMA on 7 March 2022 in connection with the CMA’s review of Pennon’s completed acquisition of Bristol Water Holdings UK Limited (the “ Bristol Water Undertakings ”). Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Pennon acknowledges that these undertakings will continue to apply notwithstanding any subsequent modification to the Instruments of Appointment of SBB and/or SES.

2.2 Pennon shall ensure that SBB and SES (or any Successor Entity) shall comply with the prevailing price controls to which each is subject.

2.3 Pennon undertakes to share half of the forecast merger-specific cost efficiencies, with a minimum to be shared of $\\pounds\[3<\]$ , with all customers of SBB and SES as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than 31 March 2030, which would be undertaken via Pennon’s WaterShare+ Scheme.

2.4 Pennon undertakes that, in respect of SES’ request to apply a ‘small company premium’ as part of its PR24 business plan submission, in the event that Ofwat does apply a ‘small company premium’ for SES at PR24 in the draft or final determination:

2.4.1 Pennon shall waive such request to the extent that a final PR24 determination has not been issued in respect of SES as of the effective date of these undertakings; or

2.4.2 to the extent that a final PR24 determination has been issued in respect of SES that incorporates a small company premium allowance, Pennon shall seek Ofwat’s consent to the disapplication of such allowance for the remainder of the PR24 period.

2.5 Pennon undertakes and confirms that it will ensure that SBB and SES (or any Successor Entity) provide Ofwat with such separate historical and forecast cost, cost driver and performance information and any other reporting of information with respect to each of the SWB Wholesale Water Activities, the BRL Wholesale Water Activities and the SES Wholesale Water Activities as may be required by Ofwat for the proper exercise of its regulatory functions including for the maintenance of separate price controls for each of the SWB Wholesale Water Activities, the BRL Wholesale Water Activities and the SES Wholesale Water Activities and to comply and be consistent with the requirements of Ofwat’s price review process and methodology from time to time.

2.6 Pennon confirms that SBB and SES (or any Successor Entity) will provide separate historical and forecast cost, cost driver and performance information and any other reporting of information with respect to each of the SWB Retail Activities, BRL Retail Activities and SES Retail Activities as may be required by Ofwat for the proper exercise of its regulatory functions, including to set a combined retail price control for the SBB and SES regions.

2.7 Pennon confirms that when reporting actual or forecast costs to Ofwat, SBB and SES (or any Successor Entity) will allocate costs to the appropriate SWB Wholesale Water Activities, BRL Wholesale Water Activities and SES Wholesale Water Activities and SWB Retail Activities, BRL Retail Activities and SES Retail Activities using a method consistent with the Regulatory Accounting Guidelines save as otherwise agreed with Ofwat from time to time. When submitting any historical or forecast cost or cost driver information to Ofwat, Pennon undertakes to submit an accompanying assurance report from an Independent Auditor containing a specific statement confirming that costs have been allocated across SBB and SES in accordance with the Regulatory Accounting Guidelines (subject to such alternative approach as agreed with Ofwat). 2.8 Pennon undertakes that the SES region will be represented at the WaterShare $^+$ Customer Advisory Panel.

# 3Compliance

Pennon shall co-operate fully with the CMA and/or Ofwat when the CMA and/or Ofwat is: (a) monitoring compliance with the provisions of these undertakings; and (b) investigating potential breaches of the provisions of these undertakings.

3.7 In circumstances where the CMA and/or Ofwat has serious concerns about Pennon’s compliance with these undertakings:

3.7.1 The CMA may, if it considers it appropriate following consultation with Ofwat, require Pennon to appoint or instruct an external auditor (at Pennon’s expense and to be approved by the CMA) to review Pennon’s compliance with these undertakings and make recommendations to ensure effective future compliance;

3.7.2 Pennon shall promptly agree on the scope of any audit required under paragraph 3.7.1, including a reasonable and prompt deadline for receiving a final audit report, and shall appoint an auditor no later than 20 working days after the CMA formally requires Pennon to do so;
