ACQUISITION BY PENNON GROUP PLC OF SUMISHO OSAKA GAS WATER UK LIMITED

We refer to your emails dated 14 December 2023, 15 December 2023, and 3 January 2024 requesting that the CMA consents to a derogation to the Initial Enforcement Order of 8 January 2024 (the ‘ Initial Order ’). The terms defined in the Initial Order and any directions issued under the Initial Order have the same meaning in this letter.

Under the Initial Order, save with the written consent of the CMA, Pennon and the Target are required to hold separate the Target business from the Pennon business and refrain from taking any action which might prejudice a reference under section 22 of the Act or impede the taking of any remedial action following such a reference.

After due consideration of your request for a derogation from the Initial Order, based on the information received from you and in the particular circumstances of this case, Pennon and the Target may carry out the following actions, in respect of the specific paragraphs:

# 1\. Paragraphs 5(c), 5(i), and 5(j) of the Initial Order

Pennon submits that it anticipates needing to fill certain vacant Pennon management positions which have been created $\[{\\mathcal{Q}}\\ll\]$ in the ordinary course of Pennon’s business and not in contemplation of the transaction. The management positions that Pennon submits that it is likely to fill during the hold separate period are listed at Annex 1 (together, the ‘ Pennon Management Positions ’).

Pennon therefore requests a derogation from paragraphs 5(c), 5(i), and 5(j) of the Initial Order to fill in the Pennon Management Positions.

The CMA consents to Pennon’s request for a derogation on the basis that: a) this derogation will not result in any integration between the Target business and the Pennon business;

b) none of the Pennon Management Positions will be filled by employees or officers of the Target without prior written consent from the CMA;

c) Pennon will notify the CMA prior to each appointment of an individual to a Pennon Management Position in its periodic compliance statements;

d) this derogation will not result in any disruption to, or impact the viability of the Pennon business or the Target business; and

e) no other organisation changes will be made to the Pennon business as a result of the proposed changes.

# 2\. Paragraphs 5(c) and 5(i) of the Initial Order

Pennon submits that it is in the process of recruiting a new Chair of the Board of Directors, following the announcement by the incumbent Chair of her intention to step down at the close of Pennon’s Annual General Meeting in 2024, scheduled for 25 July 2024. Pennon submits that the recruitment process was initiated prior to, and is unrelated to, the transaction.

Pennon therefore requests derogation from paragraphs 5(c) and 5(i) of the Initial Order to permit Pennon to appoint a new Chair of the Board of Directors during the hold separate period.

The CMA consents to Pennon’s request for a derogation on the basis that:

a) such appointment will not result in any integration between the businesses of the Target and Pennon;

b) the new Chair of the Board of Directors will have the necessary skills and experience to assume the role, and the new Chair of the Board of Directors will not be appointed without the CMA’s prior written consent (which can be given via email);

c) Pennon shall not appoint any employee or officer of the Target to the position of Chair of the Board of Directors without the CMA’s prior written consent; and

d) no other organisation changes or key staff changes will be made to the Pennon business as a result of the proposed change.

# 3\. Paragraphs 5(a) and 5(l) of the Initial Order

Pennon submits that it must exercise financial oversight of the Target in order to ensure that it is being maintained as a going concern, in addition to enabling Pennon to discharge its mandatory corporate governance obligations as a premium listed company during the hold-separate period.

Pennon therefore requests a derogation from paragraphs 5(a) and 5(l) of the Initial Order to permit $\[{\\mathcal{Q}}\\ll\]$ (Pennon’s Group General Counsel and Company Secretary) (the ‘ Designated Person ’) to exercise Pennon’s majority shareholder rights in SOGWUK on behalf of Pennon, and to receive such information as may be needed to enable the Designated Person to exercise such rights, in respect of the Reserved Matters (as defined in Annex 2) (the Delegation of Authority ).

The CMA agrees to Pennon’s request for a derogation on the basis that:

a) the Delegation of Authority is necessary to maintain the Target business as a going concern, and to enable Pennon to discharge its mandatory corporate governance obligations as a premium listed company during the hold separate period;

b) any information provided to Pennon in connection to the Reserved Matters will not be more than strictly necessary to allow the Designated Person to exercise Pennon’s majority shareholder rights on behalf of Pennon;

c) the Delegation of Authority provided to Pennon for the purposes of reviewing the Reserved Matters is granted only to the Designated Person;

d) the Designated Person is not engaged in a commercial or strategic role within the Pennon business;

e) the identity of the Designated Person cannot be changed except through written consent by the CMA (which can be given via email);

f) the thresholds for the level of expenditure that classifies as a Reserved Matter can be amended by the CMA via email if the CMA reaches a view that they are leading to frequent reporting which unnecessarily compromises the Target business’ independence;

g) the Designated Person must not consult with any other individual in the Pennon business in taking decisions on the Reserved Matters, and will sign a nondisclosure agreement in a form agreed with the CMA, which: a. covers the treatment of any commercially sensitive information they receive as a result of the Delegation of Authority; and b. ensures that any Target business information accessed for the purposes of the Delegation of Authority would only be used for decisions on Reserved Matters, and not for any other business purposes.

h) the Designated Person must not communicate with employees of the Target business except in response to requests for approval of the Reserved Matters;

i) Pennon will notify the CMA of any requests for shareholder approval made by SOGWUK in respect of the Reserved Matters and will be provided with a summary of the information shared with Pennon;

j) in the event of a proposed veto, the Designated Person is required to explain their reasoning, and Pennon will share this reasoning with the CMA at least one working day in advance of the proposed veto being exercised;

k) should remedial action be required by the CMA in relation to the Target business, any records or copies (electronic or otherwise) of business secrets, know-how, commercially-sensitive information, intellectual property or any other information of a confidential or proprietary nature, wherever they may be held, that were received from the Target business for the purposes of this derogation will be returned to the Target business and any copies destroyed, except to the extent that record retention is required by law or regulation;

l) all electronic files and emails exchanged in this context will be password protected, adequately ring-fenced, and only accessible to the Designated Individual; and

m) this derogation will not result in any pre-emptive action which might prejudice the outcome of a reference or impede the taking of any action which may be justified by the CMA’s decision on a reference.

Pennon submits that Sutton and East Surrey Water Plc (‘ SESW ’) holds an appointment as a water undertaker under section 6 of the Water Industry Act 1991, and that Condition P of the conditions of appointment requires SESW to procure from its ultimate controller a legally-enforceable undertaking in the terms described in that condition.

experience and who shall collectively have connections with and knowledge of the areas within which SESW provides water services and an understanding of the interests of its customers and how these can be respected and protected.
