Initial Enforcement Order made by the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to

section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act) as modified by the

Water Mergers (Modification of Enactments) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/3202, as amended) (the Water Modification Regulations)

Whereas:

(a) the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) is considering, pursuant to section 32 of the Water Industry Act 1991 ( WIA91 ), whether it is or may be the case that arrangements are in progress which, if carried into effect, will result in a merger of the water enterprises specified in recital (b) or whether a merger of such water enterprises has taken place;

(b) the specified water enterprises are Pennon Group Plc ( Pennon ) and Sumisho Osaka Gas Water UK Limited ( the Target ). The Target’s subsidiaries include Sutton and East Surrey Water Plc;

(c) the CMA wishes to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of any reference under section 32 of the WIA91 which might prejudice that reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA which might be justified by the CMA’s decision on the reference; and

(d) Part 3 of the Act (subject to modifications), including the CMA’s power to make an initial enforcement order under section 72(2) of the Act, applies to mergers between water enterprises and references under section 32 of the WIA91 pursuant to regulation 2 of the Water Modification Regulations.

Now for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action in accordance with section 72(2) of the Act the CMA makes the following order addressed to Pennon and the Target (the Initial Order ).

# Commencement, application and scope

1. This Initial Order commences on the commencement date: being the date of completion of the transaction.
2. This Initial Order applies to Pennon and the Target.
3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Initial Order: (a) no act or omission shall constitute a breach of this Initial Order, and nothing in this Initial Order shall oblige Pennon or the Target to reverse any act or omission, in each case to the extent that it occurred or was completed prior to the commencement date; (b) this Initial Order does not prohibit the completion of the transaction provided that Pennon and the Target observe the restrictions set out below.

# Management of the Pennon and Target businesses until determination of proceedings

4. Except with the prior written consent of the CMA, Pennon and the Target shall not, during the specified period, take any action which might prejudice a reference under section 32 of the WIA91 or impede the taking of any action by the CMA which might be justified by the CMA’s decision on such a reference, including any action which might:

(a) lead to the integration of the Target business with the Pennon business;

(b) transfer the ownership or control of the Pennon business or the Target business or any of their subsidiaries; or

(c) otherwise impair the ability of the Target business or the Pennon business to compete independently in any of the markets affected by the transaction.

5. Further and without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 4 and subject to paragraph 3, Pennon and the Target shall at all times during the specified period take all necessary steps to ensure that, except with the prior written consent of the CMA:

(a) the Target business is carried on separately from the Pennon business and the Target business’s separate sales or brand identity is maintained;

(b) the Target business and the Pennon business are maintained as a going concern and sufficient resources are made available for the development of the Target business and the Pennon business, on the basis of their respective pre-merger business plans;

(c) except in the ordinary course of business, no significant changes are made to the organisational structure of, or the management responsibilities within, the Target business or the Pennon business;

(f) there is no integration of the information technology of the Target or Pennon businesses, and the software and hardware platforms of the Target business shall remain essentially unchanged, except for routine changes and maintenance;

(g) the customer and supplier lists of the two businesses shall be operated and updated separately and any negotiations with any existing or potential customers and suppliers in relation to the Target business will be carried out by the Target business alone and for the avoidance of doubt the Pennon business will not negotiate on behalf of the Target business (and vice versa) or enter into any joint agreements with the Target business (and vice versa);

(i) no changes are made to key staff of the Target business or Pennon business;
