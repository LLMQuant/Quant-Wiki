### Invitation to comment: closed on 12 March 2024
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering pursuant to section 32(b) of the Water Industry Act 1991 (WIA91), whether it is or may be the case that a merger of two or more water enterprises has taken place and, if so, whether the creation of that situation is likely to prejudice Ofwat’s ability, in carrying out its functions, to make comparisons between water enterprises.
The CMA is issuing this preliminary ‘invitation to comment’ to allow interested parties to submit to the CMA any initial views on the impact that the transaction could have on water regulation in England and Wales. The CMA has not yet launched its formal investigation into this transaction. This invitation to comment is the first part of the CMA’s information-gathering process.
To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments on the merger from any interested party.
These comments should be provided by the deadline set out above.
### Initial enforcement order
