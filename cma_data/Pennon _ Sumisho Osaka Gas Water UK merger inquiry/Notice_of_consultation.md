# Completed Acquisition by Pennon Group Plc of Sumisho Osaka Gas Water UK Limited (now Sutton and East Surrey Group Holdings Limited)

NOTICE UNDER PARAGRAPH 2(1) OF SCHEDULE 10 TO THE ENTERPRISE ACT 2002 (THE ACT) – CONSULTATION ON PROPOSED UNDERTAKINGS IN LIEU OF REFERENCE PURSUANT TO SECTION 73 OF THE ACT.

ME/7083/23

# 1\. INTRODUCTION

1. On 10 January 2024, Pennon Group Plc ( Pennon ) acquired Sumisho Osaka Gas Water UK Limited ( SOGWUK ) (the Merger ). Following the Merger, SOGWUK’s name was changed to Sutton and East Surrey Group Holdings Limited ( SESGHL ). SESGHL’s subsidiaries include Sutton and East Surrey Water plc ( SES ). Pennon and SOGWUK are together referred to as the Parties, and, for statements relating to the future, the Merged Entity .

2. Pennon 1and SES both provide water services to household customers in England. The supply of water services to household customers is a regulated market which in England and Wales is characterised by regional suppliers who hold regional monopolies within set sub-national regions. The market is regulated by Ofwat, which carries out this role using a system of comparative regulation between the water enterprises and their sub-national regions.

3. On 3 May 2024, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) decided that it is or may be the case that a merger of two or more water enterprises has taken place, and that there is a realistic prospect that the Merger has prejudiced, or is likely to prejudice, the ability of Ofwat in carrying out its functions by virtue of the Water Industry Act 1991 ( WIA91 ), to make comparisons between water enterprises (the Reference Decision ). The text of the Reference Decision is available on the CMA webpages.

4. On 3 May 2024, Pennon offered undertakings to the CMA for the purposes of section 33D of the WIA91.

5. On 14 May, the CMA gave notice to Pennon, pursuant to section 73A(2)(b) of the Act, that it considers that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the undertakings offered, or a modified version of them, might be accepted by the CMA under section 33D of the WIA91 and that it is considering Pennon’s offer (the UIL Provisional Acceptance Decision ).


# 2\. THE UNDERTAKINGS OFFERED

6. As set out in the Reference Decision, the CMA found a realistic prospect that the Merger has prejudiced, or is likely to prejudice, the ability of Ofwat in carrying out its functions by virtue of the WIA91.

7. To address the prejudice identified by the CMA, Pennon has offered to provide separate reporting information for SES from the rest of Pennon's water businesses post-Merger (the Proposed Undertakings ). As part of the Proposed


Undertakings, Pennon will maintain the existing separate reporting for Bristol Water under the previous UILs agreed with the CMA. The Proposed Undertakings would enable Ofwat to maintain a separate wholesale water price control for SES, and the flexibility to maintain separate or combined performance targets and incentives.

# 3\. CMA ASSESSMENT

8. The CMA currently considers that, subject to responses to the consultation required by Schedule 10 of the Act, the Proposed Undertakings will resolve the prejudice identified in the Reference Decision in a clear-cut manner, ie the CMA currently does not have material doubts about the overall effectiveness of the Proposed Undertakings or concerns about their implementation. The prejudice identified by the CMA arises due to SES, which is currently a separate comparator, becoming a combined comparator with the rest of Pennon’s water businesses. As such, the CMA considers that the Proposed Undertakings, which commit to maintaining separate cost and performance information, will likely mitigate any loss in Ofwat’s ability to make comparisons between water enterprises that may arise following the Merger.

9. The CMA also considers that the Proposed Undertakings would be capable of ready implementation. In particular this is because they will require the Merged Entity to continue to report and provide information that is already currently provided independently.


# 3.1 Opinion of Ofwat

10. Ofwat is the regulator for the water sector in England and Wales. Ofwat has a set of primary and secondary duties and functions. One of the functions is to set price limits every five years, determining the maximum companies can charge customers for water and wastewater services. Ofwat also monitors the performance of the water companies to ensure that they deliver the required services and improvements in quality.

11. Ofwat carries out its role using a system of comparative regulation between the water enterprises. A water merger could affect Ofwat’s ability to make comparisons in a number of ways across each of these functions.

12. The CMA consulted with Ofwat on the nature of the undertakings submitted by Pennon, including requesting, receiving, and considering an opinion on the effect of the undertakings pursuant to section 33D(6) of the WIA91.

13. Ofwat confirmed to the CMA that it considers that the Proposed Undertakings, offered to the CMA by Pennon on 3 May 2024 adequately remedy the prejudice identified by the CMA in the Reference Decision. In particular, Ofwat submitted that it relies heavily on comparisons in order to set appropriate revenue limits and service packages. As a result, retaining separate cost, cost driver, performance and other information for the SES area is crucial. Ofwat also submitted that it requires separate reporting on both wholesale and retail activities, that it is also necessary for it to set separate wholesale price controls across the regions, but that it is not necessary to retain separate retail price controls.


# 4\. PROPOSED DECISION AND NEXT STEPS

14. For the reasons set out above, the CMA currently considers that the Proposed Undertakings are, in the circumstances of this case, appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent any loss in Ofwat’s ability to make comparisons between water enterprises that may arise following the Merger and form as comprehensive a solution to these concerns as is reasonable and practicable.

15. The CMA therefore gives notice that it proposes to accept the Proposed Undertakings in lieu of a reference of the Merger for a phase 2 investigation. The text of the proposed undertaking is available on the CMA web page.

16. Before reaching a decision as to whether to accept the Proposed Undertakings, the CMA invites interested parties to make their views known to it. The CMA will have regard to any representations made in response to this consultation and may make modifications to the Proposed Undertakings as a result. If the CMA considers that any representation necessitates any material change to the Proposed Undertakings, the CMA will give notice of the proposed modifications and publish a further consultation.

17. Representations should be made in writing to the CMA and be addressed to:
