# COMPLETEDACQUISITION BY NEC SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS UKLIMITED OF SSS PUBLIC SAFETY LIMITED AND SECURE SOLUTIONS USA LLC

Notice of extension of inquiry period under section 39(3) of the Enterprise Act 2002 1

1. On 12 May 2022, in exercise of its duty under section 22(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), made a reference to its chair for the constitution of a Group of CMA Panel Members (the Inquiry Group ) regarding the completed acquisition by NEC Software Solutions UK Limited of SSS Public Safety Limited and Secure Solutions USA LLC (previously part of Capita plc).The period within which the report on this reference was to be prepared and published (the reference period ) was due to expire on 26 October 2022.

2. The Inquiry Group issued its Provisional Findings and a Notice of Possible Remedies on 15 September 2022.

3. The Inquiry Group has decided that the reference period should be extended by eight weeks under section 39(3) of the Act as it considers that there are special reasons (set out below) why the final report cannot be prepared and published within the reference period. The revised reference period will expire on 21 December 2022. However, the Inquiry Group aims to complete the inquiry as soon as possible and in advance of this date.

4. In taking this decision, the Inquiry Group had regard to the scope and complexity of the inquiry, the need to consider issues raised by the main parties’ and third parties’ submissions, and the need to reach a fully reasoned final report in the statutory timeframe. Moreover, it is necessary to allow sufficient time to take full and proper account of comments that are anticipated in response to the Inquiry Group’s provisional findings and notice of possible remedies, and to reach a fully reasoned final decision in the statutory timeframe. In light of these factors, the Inquiry Group considers that completion of its inquiry and the publication of its final report, will not be possible within the original reference period.
