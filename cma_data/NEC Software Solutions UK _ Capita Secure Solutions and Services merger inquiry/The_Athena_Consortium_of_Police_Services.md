NEC Software Solutions UK / Capita Secure Solutions and Services Merger Inquiry

Kent Police and Essex Police Submission on Behalf of the Athena Consortium

# Introduction

1. The Athena Consortium of Police Services (the Consortium ) are grateful to the CMA Group for their kind extension of time to make submissions in respect of the Record Management Systems software (RMS) aspects of NEC Software Solutions UK Limited (NEC-UK )’s completed acquisition of SSS Public Safety Limited and Secure Solutions LLC (together SSS ) from Capita plc (the RMS Concentration ).

2. The Athena Consortium is a consortium of 9 Police Services who use a common version or ‘instance’ of the NEC-UK RMS. These Police Services are Kent, Essex, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Warwickshire and West Mercia Police. The formation of the Consortium was driven by the need to share information between forces as a result of the tragic murders leading to the Bichard Inquiry (see paragraph 6 below).

3. This submission is limited to the Consortium’s concerns that the RMS Concentration will lead to a substantial lessening of competition for RMS that will further erode value for money and prevent the required innovation allowing for the free flow of information between Police Services in the UK, which is essential for public safety.

4. Additionally, the Consortium is concerned that the market for RMS is not working well for Police Services and that there are features of the market that already give rise to significant adverse effects on competition, that harm Police Services and, in turn, harm UK citizens and others relying on the UK’s Police Services. The RMS Concentration, if allowed to proceed, will exacerbate these adverse effects. Separate to the CMA’s review of the RMS Concentration, the Consortium, therefore, additionally urges the CMA to more generally consider whether there are issues with RMS that would warrant separate closer inspection outside the confines of the Merger Inquiry.


# Background

5. Although the CMA has set out within its Provisional findings report, notified on 15 September 2022 (the Provisional Report ), its view of the relevant background facts relating to RMS, the Consortium considers it may be helpful for the Consortium to set out its own view.

6. RMS is an essential component of modern policing. RMS services, when they work well, enable Police Services to collect, collate, interrogate and share intelligence and other information between Police Officers and Police Services, contributing to the prevention of crime and public safety. Indeed, the vital importance of RMS was highlighted in the Bichard Inquiry Report 1into the tragic murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells by Ian Huntley and which Public Inquiry focused on, amongst other things, record keeping and information sharing in Humberside Police and Cambridgeshire Constabulary. The Public Inquiry indicated that better data gathering and sharing practices could have helped prevent the crimes.

7. As the CMA observes, there are two large providers of RMS in the UK, they are the NEC Corporation (NEC) and Niche Technology Inc. (Niche).

8. NEC Corporation entered the UK RMS market primarily through its acquisition of the then UK-based IT services company Northgate Public Services Limited. NEC acquired NPS from Cinven, a private equity firm, for GPB 475 million; the acquisition completed in January 2018. NEC-UK provides RMS to the Consortium. NEC-UK’s RMS product has no API (or equivalent) functionality to enable interfaces to other Police Force RMS instances and only limited private cloud type functionality.

9. Niche is a Canadian company providing RMS as a COTS 4product to police forces internationally. In the UK, Niche provides RMS to 27 Police Services. The users of the Niche RMS are required to join a user group called Minerva, and through this user group may seek to prioritise and agree RMS development requests for Niche, which Niche may then accept and develop into its RMS. The Niche product is relatively inflexible and has no current API to enable interfaces to other Police Force RMS instances or real cloud functionality.

10. SSS currently provide RMS to, the Consortium understands, two Police Services, including Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ). The SSS RMS has suffered from a lack of development and does not have an API to enable interfaces to other Police Force RMS instances or cloud functionality.

11. There are a few smaller RMS providers, including Mark 43, who the Consortium understands have recently agreed to provide RMS to Cumbria Police in place of the incumbent. Mark 43 are based in the USA and importantly, are a new entrant to the UK RMS market and a truly native cloud-based RMS provider with potential API functionality to enable interfaces to other Police Force RMS instances.


# Limitations of RMS in the UK

12. For RMS to be fully effective it is necessary that the RMS enables the information that they contain to be shared, not just between Police Officers within a Police Service, but also between different Police Services. For example, if Police Services were able to access each other’s RMS, a Police Officer in one Police Service could access other Police Service’s RMS to check whether a person in custody is wanted for questioning in respect of a crime in another Police Service’s area and notify that other Police Service.

13. NEC-UK, Niche and Capita’s RMS are designed in such a way that each instance of their RMS is not able to be accessed by, or information shared, by other instances of that RMS or indeed by other RMS. To get round this problem, at least to a limited extent, some Police Services group together to use the same instance of an RMS, to enable the sharing of information and intelligence across those Police Services, but not further.

14. The Athena Consortium is an example of this practice. However, clearly the benefits are limited to just those Police Services who are members of that specific consortium and served by that specific RMS instance and, clearly, does not allow sharing of information between RMS (or instances of RMS) not used by the consortium, including by neighbouring Police Services who are not members of the consortium.

15. This consortium effect has led to areas of the country being served exclusively or to a significant extent, by one or other of either Niche or NEC-UK. For example, the East Midlands is served exclusively by Niche, likewise all of Wales.

16. In an ideal world each RMS (or instance of an RMS) would allow, through an API or other interface or form of interworking, information to flow between Police Services. The Consortium understands that neither NEC-UK or Niche have API (or equivalent) capability of this nature, or full cloud-functionality (noting NEC operate a private cloud service and have cloud migration on their development roadmap 7), and the Consortium believes that neither Niche nor NEC-UK see the development of full-cloud functionality and APIs (or equivalent) as being in their commercial interest. Smaller, progressive, flexible and innovative providers, including Mark 43, allow such APIs and are fully cloud based. In other words, the widespread lack of interoperability between different instances of the same RMS and between different RMS not only creates public safety issues, it also makes switching between providers difficult for users and reinforces the incumbency advantage of the relevant provider.


# RMS Competition

17. The Consortium is concerned that the consortium effect (see paragraphs 13 to 15) and or the structure of tenders may lead to new entrants or providers who do not have a live service with another Police Service being excluded and that other requirements, for example, a requirement for cloud functionality, may result in one or other of Niche or NEC-UK not bidding, where they are not the incumbent.

# Substantial Lessening of Competition

18. The Consortium is concerned to ensure as much competition as possible for RMS is preserved and encouraged.

19. By way of example, the Consortium understands that \[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx\] are currently preparing for or are re-tendering their RMS requirements.

20. Focusing on England and Wales, \[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\] Police Service in England and Wales. It is believed that \[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\]. \[xxxxxx\] therefore appears to represent one of the few current opportunities in England and Wales for \[xxxxxx\] RMS providers, who might be more inclined to include an API as part of their solution, to get a foothold and compete actively with NEC and Niche and obtain a significant customer.

21. This would, in the Consortium’s view, be likely to reinforce NEC-UK’s incumbency advantage and further diminish any incentive on its part to develop any API (or equivalent) functionality enhance its private cloud type functionality, which would be necessary to ensure greater competition for RMS and optimal communication between Forces in the long term.


# NEC’s Market Share

22. The Consortium understands that the CMA has used three metrics to assess market share: (a) shares by revenue $(%)$ ; (b) shares by volume of recorded crimes $(%)$ ; and (c) number of police forces (go-live) $(%)$ . While the Consortium agrees that share by revenue $(%)$ is a helpful indicator of market share, the Consortium has doubts that the number of Police Services served provides a good basis for market share, given the differing size in Police Services, e.g. the Metropolitan Police versus Warwickshire. In respect of shares by volume of recorded crimes, while this may have merit as it seeks to link the RMS to a recorded statistic, it does not directly represent Police Officer usage of RMS.

23. In addition to market share and volume of recorded crime, the Consortium considers that share of Police Officers $(%)$ would provide a valid and appropriate way to assess market share. For England and Wales, data is published through the Home Office’s Statistics on police workforce numbers in the 43 police forces in England and Wales and the British Transport Police (the Police Number Statistics ). This could be either based on ‘all officers’ or ‘officers available for duty’.

24. The Police Number Statistics show that for March 2022, ignoring Central service secondments and the National Crime Agency, there were 143,188 Police Officers in England and Wales and the British Transport Police. Of this number, there were 26 Police Services served by Niche (removing the Police Service of Northern Ireland) with a total ‘all officers’ count of 61,340 officers. The Consortium understands that Mark 43 will be serving Cumbria, which has 1,295 ‘all officers’ and that GMP is served by SSS and has 7,388 ‘all officers’. This means that NEC-UK would currently support up to 70,023 ‘all officers’ representing up to $49%$ of the market in England and Wales, and including GMP, a share of $54%$ . This is compared to Niche’s market share of $43%$ .

25. In respect of NEC’s market share, it is worth noting that NEC has (or will have if the RMS Concentration stands), RMS contracts with the 3 biggest Police Services in England and Wales, the Metropolitan Police, West Midlands Police and Greater Manchester Police, as well as the Athena Consortium (which is the largest consortium for RMS in the country), which together cover very significant Police Service regions. For the reasons explained in paragraphs 13 to 15, this has the effect of NEC’s and Niche’s shares becoming regionalised and potential competition deserts.


# Non-confidential (confidential redactions shown \[xxxx\])

# Potential Effect of the Concentration

26. In the Consortium’s view, the value for money provided, the quality of service, and the innovation provided by NEC-UK, Niche and SSS is poor. The way that the existing RMS providers operate, the commercial drivers forcing the maintenance of consortiums by the providers not offering workable APIs (or equivalent), and other features of the market, do not incentivise the providers to innovate in a way that would release the full benefit of Police Services having interconnected RMS throughout the UK through true cloud-provision and APIs.

27. The Concentration will frustrate the potential for new-entrants (such as Mark 43) or existing smaller providers to compete (leading to exit), such that there will be limited competition that encourages either NEC-UK or Niche to improve their services and the value that they offer. This in turn will create, and further entrench, an uncompetitive duopoly of NEC-UK and Niche.


# Conclusion and Remedies

28. For the reasons set out in this Submission the Consortium urges the CMA to rethink its position on whether the RMS Concentration gives rise to an SLC and to more fully investigate the likely effect of the concentration on RMS competition.

29. Should the CMA consider that there is in fact a SLC for RMS, the Consortium would urge the CMA to continue to require NEC to divest itself of SSS, including RMS, or if RMS is not to be divested, at the very least, to require NEC to develop its RMS to provide API functionality to enable interfaces to other Police Force RMS instances.
