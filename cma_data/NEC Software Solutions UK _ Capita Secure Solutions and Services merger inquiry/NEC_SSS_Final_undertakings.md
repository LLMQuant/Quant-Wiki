# Background

A. On 3 January 2022, NEC Software Solutions UK Limited acquired the entire issued share capital of SSS Public Safety Limited 1(SSS ) and Secure Solutions USA LLC 2from Capita Secure Information Solutions Limited and Capita (USA) Holdings Inc. ( Capita ) (the Merger ). For the purposes of these Final Undertakings, NEC Software Solutions UK Limited and NPS (Holdings) Limited are referred to together as " NECSWS ".

B. On 21 December 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority (the CMA ) made an initial enforcement order ( IEO ) pursuant to section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ) for the purpose of preventing pre-emptive action in accordance with that section. On 30 May 2022, the CMA issued directions under the IEO for the appointment of a monitoring trustee (the Monitoring Trustee ) in order to monitor and ensure compliance with the IEO.

C. On 12 May 2022, the CMA, in accordance with section 22(1) of the Act, referred the Merger to a group of CMA panel members to determine, pursuant to section 35 of the Act: (i) whether a relevant merger situation has been created; and (ii) if so, whether the creation of that situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) in any market or markets in the United Kingdom ( UK ) for goods or services.

D. On 2 December 2022, the CMA published a final report pursuant to section 38 of the Act (the Report ) which concluded that: (i) the Merger has created a relevant merger situation; (ii) the creation of that situation has resulted in, or may be expected to result in, an SLC in relation to the supply of Integrated Communication and Control Services software ( ICCS ) in the UK and an SLC in relation

to the supply of Duties Management Systems software to police forces (Duties ) in the UK; and

(iii) the CMA should take action to remedy the SLCs and any adverse effects resulting from them.

E. The CMA, having regard to its findings in the Report, requires:

(i) a divestiture of the business for the supply of ICCS in the UK carried on by NECSWS (consisting of the ICCS Divestiture Business ) to an Approved Purchaser; and

(ii) a divestiture of either the business for the supply of Duties in the UK carried on by NECSWS or the business for the supply of Duties in the UK carried on by SSS (the Duties Divestiture Business ) to an Approved Purchaser

(together the Remedies ).

F. The implementation of the Remedies will be subject to the following safeguards:

(a) NECSWS will be subject to regular reporting requirements;

(b) the Monitoring Trustee will monitor compliance with these Final Undertakings, including the progress of the implementation of the Remedies;

(c) the purchaser for each of the Remedies must be an Approved Purchaser in accordance with the Purchaser Approval Criteria in Annex 1 and

(d) provisions enabling the CMA to direct the appointment of a Divestiture Trustee to effect the final disposal of the ICCS Divestiture Business and/or the Duties Divestiture Business in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 10.

G. The IEO ceases to be in force on the date of acceptance by the CMA, pursuant to section 82 of the Act, of these Final Undertakings. Any derogations already granted by the CMA pursuant to the IEO shall remain applicable .

H. Now therefore each of NECSWS and SSS give to the CMA on behalf of itself and, where relevant, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, the following Final Undertakings pursuant to section 82 of the Act for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the SLC identified in the Report and any adverse effects resulting from it.

(a) to give effect to and implement the Final Disposal within the Divestiture Period in compliance with these Final Undertakings, having due regard to the findings in the Report;

(b) to procure that their Subsidiaries do all things necessary to ensure the Parties are able to comply with these Final Undertakings;

(a) submit for approval by the CMA, within three Working Days following the commencement of the Divestiture Period, or such other period as may be agreed by the CMA, a proposed timetable setting out the key milestones to ensure completion of the Final Disposal within the Divestiture Period;

(b) to notify the CMA as soon as reasonably practicable of any material changes or amendments to the Approved Timetable. The CMA will as soon as reasonably practicable either approve this timetable as proposed or require reasonable amendments to it and will notify NECSWS of the Approved Timetable;

(c) submit for approval by the CMA, in accordance with the Approved Timetable, a list of potential purchasers of the relevant Divestiture Business, and to provide the CMA with information to demonstrate that a potential purchaser meets the Purchaser Approval Criteria and with

such information reasonably required by the CMA within any deadline set by the CMA;

(d) submit for approval by the CMA, in accordance with the Approved Timetable and prior to entering into any transaction agreement with an Approved Purchaser, the final terms of the divestiture, and provide all draft transaction agreements or other information the CMA may require within any deadline set by the CMA;

These Purchaser Approval Criteria are to be construed in a manner that is consistent with, and for the purpose of giving effect to, the Report in the Relevant Markets.

The CMA shall on reasonable request give NECSWS guidance on the interpretation of specific aspects of these Purchaser Approval Criteria, so as to enable NECSWS to ensure that its selected purchaser for the Divestiture Business will meet the requirements of this Annex 1.

# 1\. Independence

1.1 An Approved Purchaser should not have any connection (for example financial, management, shared directorships, equity interests, reciprocal commercial arrangements) to NECSWS and/or SSS that could reasonably be expected to compromise the Approved Purchaser’s ability or incentives to compete with the Merged Entity after the Final Disposal.

c. in order to implement the Trustee Obligation, the CMA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the Divestiture Trustee, give written directions or instructions to the Divestiture Trustee to amend the scope of the relevant Divestiture Business, where the CMA has reasonable grounds for believing that the divestiture of the Divestiture Business cannot be achieved within the Divestiture Period;

16.NECSWS shall be entitled to a monthly statement from the Divestiture Trustee of all professional fees and expenses properly incurred by the Divestiture Trustee and its advisers, appointed in accordance with clause 6. Any individual items of costs or expenses in excess of an amount at a level set in advance by the CMA in consultation with the Divestiture Trustee shall not be properly incurred unless with the prior written consent of the CMA, NECSWS having had prior opportunity to comment to the CMA on both the level to be set in advance and any individual items of cost or expense that exceed that amount, on the condition that NECSWS shall provide such comments to the CMA within a timescale specified by the CMA that shall be reasonable in all the circumstances.

17.NECSWS shall remunerate and reimburse the Divestiture Trustee for all professional fees, expenses and reasonable costs properly incurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of its appointment.
