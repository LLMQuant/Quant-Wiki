(c) the CMA should take action to remedy the SLCs found and any adverse effects resulting from them; and

(d) having regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable, the following businesses should be divested:

i. the NECSWS ICCS business, and ii. the NECSWS Duties business or the SSS Duties business, (together the Divestment Businesses )

(e) undertakings should be given to the CMA or, where undertakings are not agreed, an order should be made to give effect to the remedies identified by the CMA in chapter 11 of the Report, namely the divestiture of the Divestment Businesses.

3. The CMA has reached agreement with NECSWS and SSS as to the terms of the final undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the SLCs it has identified in the Report and any adverse effects arising from these SLCs. The proposed final undertakings (the proposed Final Undertakings ) are attached to this notice.
