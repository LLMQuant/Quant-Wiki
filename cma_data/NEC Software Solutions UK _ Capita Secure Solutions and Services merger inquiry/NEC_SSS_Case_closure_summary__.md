# Merger investigation into the completed acquisition by NEC Software Solutions UK Limited of SSS Public Safety Limited and Secure Solutions USA LLC

# Case closure summary

On 3 January 2022, NEC Software Solutions UK Limited (NECSWS )acquired the entire issued share capital of SSS Public Safety Limited and Secure Solutions USA LLC from Capita Secure Information Solutions Limited and Capita (USA) Holdings Inc. (the Merger ).

A group of independent panel members (the Group ) at the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) investigated the Merger and published its Final Report on 2 December 2022. In its Final Report, the Group concluded that:

(a) the Merger created a relevant merger situation;

(b) the creation of that situation resulted in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) in relation to the supply of Integrated Communication and Control Services software ( ICCS ) in the UK and an SLC in relation to the supply of Duties Management Systems software to police forces ( Duties ) in the UK;

(c) the CMA should take action to remedy the SLCs and any adverse effects resulting from them; and

(d) having regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable, required: a. a divestiture of the business for the supply of ICCS in the UK carried on by NECSWS (consisting of the ICCS Divestiture Business); and b. a divestiture of either the business for the supply of Duties in the UK carried on by NECSWS or the business for the supply of Duties in the UK carried on by SSS (the Duties Divestiture Business).

On 10 February 2023, the CMA accepted Final Undertakings from NECSWS to sell the ICCS Divestiture Business and the Duties Divestiture Business to a purchaser approved by the CMA and on 1 August 2023 the ICCS Divestiture Business and the Duties Divestiture Business were acquired by Codan Radio Communications Pty Limited.

This brings the merger investigation to a close.
