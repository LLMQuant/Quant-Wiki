# REFERENCE RELATING TO THE ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION BY ADOBE INC. OF FIGMA, INC

Notice of provisional findings made under Rule 11.3 of the Competition and Markets Authority Rules of Procedure 11. On 13 July 2023, in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), made a reference to its chair for the constitution of a Group of CMA Panel Members (the Inquiry Group )2regarding the anticipated acquisition by Adobe Inc. (Adobe ) of Figma, Inc. ( Figma ) for further investigation and report and requiring it to report within a period ending 27 December 2023.

2. On 16 August 2023 the Inquiry Group decided pursuant to section 39(4) of the Act that the reference period should be extended as a result of the failure by Figma to comply with the requirements of a notice issued on 1 August 2023 under section 109 of the Act to provide certain documents and information (the section 109 notice ). A notice of extension was published on the inquiry webpage on 17 August 2023.

3. On 21 August 2023, the CMA was satisfied, for the purposes of section 39(8) of the Act, that the documents and information required by the section 109 notice had been provided. The CMA accordingly terminated the extension of the reference period and 4 days were added to the statutory deadline such that the reference period was due to expire on 31 December 2023. The notice of termination of extension was published on the inquiry webpage the same day.

4. On 25 October 2023, the CMA published on its website a notice of extension of the reference period by eight weeks under section 39(3) of the Act. The Inquiry Group is now required to report within a period ending on 25 February 2024.

10. The Inquiry Group is also publishing a notice of possible remedies ( Remedies Notice ).
