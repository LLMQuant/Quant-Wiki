### Invitation to comment: closed on 6 February 2024
23 January 2024: The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering whether it is or may be the case that this merger has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.
To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments on the transaction from any interested party.
These comments should be provided by the deadline set out above.
### Initial enforcement order
28 November 2023: The Competition and Markets Authority has served an initial enforcement order under section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Pharmacy2U, P2U Holdings Limited, G Square Capital II L.P., G Square Healthcare Private Equity LLP and Lloyds Direct.
