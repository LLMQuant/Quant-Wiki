UNDERTAKINGS IN LIEU OF A REFERENCE

# ACQUISITION BY ALLIANCE PROPERTY HOLDINGS LIMITED, A WHOLLY OWNEDSUBSIDIARY OF WM MORRISON SUPERMARKETS LIMITED, OF THE ASSETS ANDBUSINESS OF MCCOLL'S RETAIL GROUP PLC (IN ADMINISTRATION)

Undertakings given by Wm Morrison Supermarkets Limited ("Morrisons") to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# WHEREAS:

(A). Morrisons completed the acquisition of the assets and business of McColl's Retail Group plc (" MRG ") on 9 May 2022 by way of the acquisition of certain assets of MRG, Martin McColl Limited, Clark Retail Limited, Dillons Stores Limited, Smile Stores Limited, Charnwait Management Limited and Martin Retail Group Limited (these assets are collectively referred to as " McColl's ") (the " Transaction ") such that Morrisons and McColl's ceased to be distinct for the purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the " Act ");

(B). Under section 22(1) of the Act the Competition and Markets Authority (" CMA ") has a duty to refer a relevant merger situation for a Phase 2 investigation where it believes that it is or may be the case that the creation of that merger situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or services;

(C). Under section 73 of the Act the CMA may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it, accept undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate, from such of the parties concerned as it considers appropriate. In particular, the CMA shall have regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(D). As set out in the CMA's decision of 8 September 2022 (the " Decision "), the CMA believes that, in the absence of appropriate undertakings, it would be under a duty to refer the Transaction for a Phase 2 investigation;

(E). The CMA considers that the undertakings given below by Morrisons are appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from the Transaction, or may be expected to result from it, as specified in the Decision; and

(F). The CMA made an Initial Enforcement Order (" IEO ") applying to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Holdings, LLC (" CD&R "); Motor Fuel Limited and CD&R Firefly Holdco Limited (referred to together as " MFG "); Market Bidco Limited, Market Topco Limited and each of the subsidiaries of Morrisons (other than Alliance Property Holdings Limited); and Alliance Property Holdings Limited on 25 May 2022 in respect of the Transaction pursuant to section 72 of the Act for the purposes of preventing pre-emptive action. Pursuant to section 72(6)(b) of the Act, this IEO ceases to be in force on the acceptance by the CMA of the undertakings given below by Morrisons.

NOW THEREFORE Morrisons hereby gives to the CMA the following undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it.

# 1\. EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE UNDERTAKINGS

1.1 These undertakings shall take effect from the date that, having been signed by Morrisons, they are accepted by the CMA.

# 2\. DIVESTMENT OF THE DIVESTMENT SITES

2.1 Morrisons shall, using its best endeavours and acting in good faith, as soon as reasonably practicable, effect to the satisfaction of the CMA the divestment of the Divestment Sites as a going concern by the end of the Divestment Period to a purchaser (or purchasers) approved by the CMA in accordance with the provisions of these undertakings.

2.2 Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 2.1 above, Morrisons shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure the transfer of Key Staff with the divestment of the Divestment Sites.

2.3 Morrisons shall be deemed to have complied with its obligations at paragraph 2.1 above if, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event by the end of the Divestment Period, it has entered into a legally binding agreement (or agreements) with a purchaser (or purchasers) approved in advance by the CMA in writing pursuant to these undertakings (or a legally binding agreement (or agreements) conditional on such approval), provided that the completion of the divestment of the Divestment Sites contemplated by such agreement (or agreements), if later than the end of the Divestment Period, takes place:

(a) within a period not exceeding one month after the approval of the purchaser (or purchasers) by the CMA (or within one month of the effective date of these undertakings, as set out in paragraph 1 above, whichever is later); or

(b) within a period not exceeding ten Working Days after all the necessary approvals and consents from third parties have been obtained,

whichever is later, provided that in any event, the completion of the divestment of the Divestment Sites takes place within seven months of the effective date of these undertakings (defined in paragraph 1 above).

2.4 Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 2.1 above, Morrisons shall take the following measures to the extent they may be necessary in the opinion of the CMA to effect the divestment of the Divestment Sites in accordance with the provisions of these undertakings:

(a) the transfer or vesting of property, assets, rights, personnel, liabilities or obligations (including without prejudice any contracts, licences, authorisations, permits or consents). Where the leasehold for the relevant Divestment Site(s) is vested with MRG, Morrisons shall use its best endeavours to procure the assignment of the lease from MRG: (i) directly to the purchaser (or purchasers); or (ii) to Alliance as the interim tenant, and

subsequently procure the assignment of the lease from Alliance to the purchaser (or purchasers); (b) the adjustment of contracts, whether by discharge or reduction or assignment of any liability or obligation or otherwise; (c) the creation, allotment, transfer, surrender or cancellation of any shares, stock or securities; and (d) the formation or winding up of a company.

2.5 Morrisons shall ensure that the divestment agreement entered into for the purposes of paragraph 2.1 and 2.3 above includes a warranty that the purchaser (or purchasers) has the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Sites as part of a viable and active business in competition with Morrisons and other competitors in the retail supply of groceries, in the relevant local area.

2.6 In the event that Morrisons fails to divest the Divestment Sites in accordance with paragraphs 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 above, the CMA may, whether or not initiating the Trustee Functions as set out in paragraph 4 below, require Morrisons to divest the Divestment Sites as a going concern at no minimum price to a purchaser (or purchasers) approved by the CMA.

2.7 Morrisons shall notify the CMA in writing of the identity of each Proposed Purchaser that makes an offer for the Divestment Sites together with the value and terms of such offers as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt of such offers and in any event within five Working Days of receipt of such offers.

# 3\. APPROVAL OF PURCHASERS AND TERMS OF DIVESTMENT

(a) the acquisition by the Proposed Purchaser of the Divestment Sites, on the terms set out above, remedies, mitigates or prevents the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it, or may be expected to result from it, in particular having regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(b) the Proposed Purchaser is independent of and unconnected to Morrisons and the Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate to which Morrisons belongs and any Associated Person or Affiliate of Morrisons or such Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate;

(d) the Proposed Purchaser is reasonably to be expected to obtain all necessary approvals, licences and consents from any regulatory or other authority, including (where applicable) landlord's consent to the transfer of any leasehold interest; and

(e) the acquisition by the Proposed Purchaser of the Divestment Sites does not create a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK.
