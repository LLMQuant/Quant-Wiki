## Decision to undertake review
20 July 2023: The CMA has decided to review the undertakings in lieu of a reference offered in relation to the completed acquisition of McColl’s by Morrisons. The review will consider whether there has been any change of circumstances such that the current undertakings are no longer appropriate and should be varied or superseded. The review will consider Morrisons’ variation request and submission that there has been a material change in circumstances in relation to the Divestment Site at 36 High Street, Pewsey, SN9 5AQ.
