We decided to take the opportunity to express our support of the MS acquisition of Activision/Blizzard in this mail.

There are two main reasons for why we felt compelled to do so.

1. We honestly found the arguments against this acquisition to be slightly exaggerated and out of proportion. We are worried that actual real competition and more innovative consumer friendly initiatives, could be potentially hindered by blocking this, by potential market leaders/competitors, who might not be ready or might believe in a different strategy, or just not compelled to change their status quo on the market.
2. While we do not want to point fingers at anyone's struggle to create and maintain a good culture for employees, as this is challenging for any company and has always been, we do see that a change in "scenery" with a new home at MS might be good for some of our colleague's working in the studios on the various projects.

This is two cents from us,

Thank you!
