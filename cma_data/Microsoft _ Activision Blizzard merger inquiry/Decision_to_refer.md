The SLC Decision stated that the CMA would refer the Merger for a phase 2 investigation pursuant to section 33(1), and in accordance with section 34ZA(2) of the Act, if no undertakings for the purposes of section 73(2) of the Act were offered to the CMA by the end of this period (ie by 8 September 2022); if the Parties indicated before this deadline that they did not wish to offer such undertakings; or if the undertakings offered were not accepted.
