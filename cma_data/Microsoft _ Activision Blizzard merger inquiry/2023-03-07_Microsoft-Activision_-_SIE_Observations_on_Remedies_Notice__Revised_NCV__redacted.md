Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Observations on the CMA’s Remedies Notice 1. Sony Interactive Entertainment (“SIE”) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the CMA’s notice of possible remedies (“Remedies Notice”) in connection with its provisional findings (“PFs”) on the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard transaction (the “Transaction”).

2. Based on a compelling body of evidence – including 3 million Microsoft and Activision documents, over 50 requests for information, more than 2,100 emails from the public, and multiple categories of economic data – the PFs find that Microsoft could substantially lessen competition $(^{\\bullet\\bullet}\\underline{{\\mathrm{SLC}}}^{\\bullet\\bullet})$ in consoles and cloud gaming by withholding Activision content, in particular Call of Duty , from its competitors. SIE agrees with the CMA’s assessment. SIE also concurs with the CMA’s view, as set out in the Remedies Notice, that the harm the Transaction would cause could only be addressed through prohibition or structural remedies.

3. The Remedies Notice considers an argument made by Microsoft that a behavioural commitment would be suitable because of “ existing and potential contractual arrangements with third-party platforms relating to access to Call of Duty .” 1Microsoft appears to suggest that such arrangements could prevent any loss of competition arising from the Transaction. But the existence of such arrangements today says nothing about whether they are capable of addressing the competition concerns identified in the PFs, in particular given that those concerns reflect the CMA’s determination that the merged entity’s post-Transaction incentives would be very different from Activision’s current incentives.

4. In any event, the Remedies Notice explains that none of the circumstances in which the CMA would approve the Transaction based on a behavioural remedy are present. The CMA could not be clearer that “ the circumstances in which the CMA might select a behavioural remedy as the primary source of remedial action are not present in this case ,” 2including because of the dynamic nature of the two markets in which an SLC is identified.

5. Accordingly, the CMA explains that “ any behavioural remedy in this case is likely to present material effectiveness risks. ”3SIE agrees. As explained below, the dynamic and evolving nature of the gaming industry; the competitive lever that a behavioural commitment would give Microsoft over PlayStation’s fate (for example, by controlling Call of Duty pricing and quality); and Microsoft’s history of non-compliance with behavioural commitments mean that behavioural remedies are not suited to this case.

6. This paper proceeds first by examining the structural remedies proposed in the Remedies Notice: full prohibition and divestiture of parts of Activision’s business. Section I explains how prohibiting the Transaction would effectively address the competitive harms identified in the PFs. Section II shows that divesting parts of Activision’s business would also address the CMA’s competition concerns.

7. The paper then turns to an examination of behavioural remedies. Section III explains why behavioural remedies are not suitable in this case. Using Microsoft’s proposal to SIE regarding access to Call of Duty as illustration, it explains that any access commitment would be inadequate. It also suggests, through an examination of Microsoft’s past conduct, why any behavioural commitment offered by Microsoft should be treated with caution. Section IV concludes.


# I. The Transaction Should Be Prohibited

8. The CMA’s Merger Remedies Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) explain that, when considering remedies, the CMA must respect the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to address the competitive harm the CMA has identified and any adverse effects resulting from it. The CMA will therefore seek remedies that can effectively address the harm and its effects in the least costly, intrusive, and disproportionate manner. 9. The Remedies Notice identifies prohibition of the Transaction as a “ comprehensive solution ”to the competition concerns the CMA has identified in the PFs. It also finds that the risks of this remedy “ are very low. ”6SIE agrees. Prohibiting the Transaction would safeguard against the foreclosure strategies Microsoft could employ to withhold or degrade access to Activision content. It would, by definition, restore the pre-Transaction competitive conditions. And it would do so in a clear-cut, proportionate, and straightforward manner. II. A Structural Divestiture Could Also Address The Competition Concerns Raised By The Transaction

9. SIE agrees with the Remedies Notice that divesting parts of Activision’s business could also address the CMA’s competition concerns. The Remedies Notice proposes divesting either: (i) Activision’s Call of Duty business; (ii) its Activision business segment; or (iii) both its Activision and Blizzard business segments. These divestment options would ensure that critical Activision content, such as Call of Duty and, under the CMA’s third option, World of Warcraft , would remain in independent hands. Post-divestment, there would also be no need for further monitoring or enforcement.

10. In considering divestment options, the CMA would need to ensure that the divested entity would be able to compete viably, on a standalone basis, and without support of those parts of Activision’s business that might remain with Microsoft ( e.g. , the King business). SIE is not aware of the extent to which the Activision business units identified in the Remedies Notice are integrated together as a whole such that divesting one or more of these units could impair the divested entity’s ability to compete and innovate on a standalone basis. SIE trusts that the CMA will take this account in weighing up different remedy options.


III. CMA Guidance, Microsoft’s Recent Proposal, And Microsoft’s Past Conduct Show That Behavioural Commitments Are Not Suitable In This Case

12. The Remedies Notice does not propose a behavioural remedy to address the competitive harm identified in the PFs. Instead, it states that the CMA will consider the possibility of a behavioural remedy in response to Microsoft’s submissions about existing and potential contractual protections. Notably, the Remedies Notice does not discuss what a behavioural remedy might entail. And it expresses scepticism that any behavioural remedy could effectively resolve the competition concerns the PFs found.

13. For several reasons, behavioural remedies are not suitable in this case. First, none of the circumstances identified in the Guidelines for behavioural remedies are present (Section III.A ). Second, behavioural remedies in this case would raise the risks that the Guidelines seek to avoid ( Section III.B ). Third, behavioural remedies cannot adequately address the myriad ways Microsoft could circumvent its obligations ( Section III.C ). This is confirmed by the agreement, alluded to in the Remedies Notice, that Microsoft has proposed to SIE to maintain Call of Duty on PlayStation ( Section III.D ). Microsoft’s past conduct of violating behavioural commitments and promises to the public further shows that its representations must be treated with caution ( Section III.E ).


A. None Of The Circumstances Identified In The Guidelines For A Behavioural Remedy Are Present Here

14. The Guidelines set out a well-established framework for when a behavioural remedy can in principle address an SLC arising from a merger. As a preliminary point, the Guidelines explain that behavioural remedies are less likely to deal with the source of a competition concern; less likely to have an effective impact on the competition concern and its resulting effects; more likely to create significant costly distortions in market outcomes; and often require monitoring and enforcement once implemented.

15. In light of these concerns, the CMA has made clear that it will generally only consider behavioural remedies in three circumstances. As the Remedies Notice notes, none of these circumstances are present in this case:


●Whether divestiture or prohibition is feasible. The CMA may consider behavioural remedies if divestiture or prohibition are not feasible ( e.g ., a transaction has closed and the businesses are integrated). Divestiture and prohibition are eminently feasible in this case: the Transaction has not yet completed and Activision remains an independent entity.

●Whether the SLC is expected to have a short duration. If an SLC is expected to be of a very short duration, the CMA may consider a behavioural remedy as a stopgap before broader industry developments rectify the harm resulting from a transaction. But there is nothing to suggest that this is the case here. Activision content, in particular Call of Duty , is and will continue to be an essential input for the gaming industry. The tremendous success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare $I I$ is testament to the ongoing importance and irreplaceability of the franchise. And the PFs specifically identify an SLC in cloud gaming, which is a nascent area that could take decades to evolve to maturity.

●Whether behavioural measures can preserve substantial customer benefits that would be removed by structural remedies. A third reason the CMA may consider a behavioural remedy is where there are substantial customer benefits that would be preserved by a behavioural remedy but not a structural one. There is no evidence of that being the case here. In particular, any behavioural commitment from Microsoft to grant rivals access to Call of Duty could pose a greater, not lesser, risk for consumers, as the myriad ways Microsoft could withhold or degrade access would be extremely difficult to monitor and police. If Microsoft failed to comply with its commitment, it would likely only risk paying a fine (possibly many years later). But rivals’ access to Call of Duty would be immediately foreclosed, irreparably damaging their ability to compete and ultimately harming consumers.

# Behavioural Remedies Would Raise Risks That The Guidelines Seek To Avoid

16. The Guidelines and the Remedies Notice make clear that behavioural remedies should avoid four specific types of risk. For the reasons explained below, these risks are all apparent in the present case:

fairness, reasonableness, and non-discrimination? 16 The situation is therefore diametrically different to a regulated industry where the CMA has, on a few occasions, considered licensing commitments that a sectoral regulator has the expertise and resources to act as a price regulator on an ongoing basis.

21. Second, the partial foreclosure mechanisms described above could arise even without an active decision on the part of Microsoft to degrade Call of Duty on PlayStation. Instead, partial foreclosure could result simply from Microsoft’s differing incentives postTransaction as compared to an independent Activision. Post-Transaction, Microsoft will need to make choices about the support it will provide to develop any PlayStation version of Call of Duty . Even if Microsoft operated in good faith, it would be incentivised to support and prioritise development of the Xbox version of the game, such as by using its best engineers and more of its resources. There would be no practical way for the CMA (or SIE) to monitor how Microsoft chooses to allocate its resources and the quality/quantity of engineers it devotes to the PlayStation version of Call of Duty , to ensure that SIE would be treated fairly and equally.

22. Third, swiftly detecting any diversions from, and ensuring compliance with, a commitment as to technical or graphical quality would be challenging. For example, Microsoft might release a PlayStation version of Call of Duty where bugs and errors emerge only on the game’s final level or after later updates. Even if such degradations could be swiftly detected, any remedy would likely come too late, by which time the gaming community would have lost confidence in PlayStation as a go-to venue to play Call of Duty . Indeed, as Modern Warfare II attests, Call of Duty is most often purchased in just the first few weeks of release. If it became known that the game’s performance on PlayStation was worse than on Xbox, Call of Duty gamers could decide to switch to Xbox, for fear of playing their favourite game at a second-class or less competitive venue.

# E. Microsoft Has In The Past Not Complied With Behavioural Commitments Or Has Not Respected Public Statements

27. Microsoft has in the past made commitments to regulators that it did not keep: ●First, the European Commission (“EC”) found in 2004 that Microsoft committed an abuse via its dominant Windows operating system $(^{\\bullet\\bullet}\\mathrm{QS^{\\circ}})$ by depriving rivals of indispensable interoperability information. The EC ordered Microsoft to supply the input to rivals at reasonable fees, an order Microsoft agreed to follow. This would be broadly the same kind of promise that Microsoft would be making to licence Activision content to rivals. Microsoft later violated the EC’s order by demanding unreasonable royalty fees and patent payments for the interoperability information, leading the EC to fine the software company $\\mathbb{S}1.3$ billion. As Neelie Kroes, then-EC Competition Commissioner, stated: “ Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of EU competition policy that the commission has had to fine for failure to comply with an antitrust decision…I hope that today’s decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft’s record of noncompliance .” 24

●Second, the EC raised concerns in 2009 that Microsoft had illegally tied its Internet Explorer browser to Windows OS. To resolve the case, Microsoft promised the EC that, among other things, Windows would include an internet browser choice screen to enable users to select their default browser. But Microsoft removed the browser choice screen from its Windows service pack released between 2011 and 2012, causing the EC to fine Microsoft $\\mathbb{S}731$ million for violating its commitments. Microsoft later took “ full responsibility ”for the breach and “ apologiz\[ed\] ” for it.

28. While not a violation of a behavioural commitment, Microsoft’s conduct in relation to the ZeniMax acquisition provides additional evidence of why a behavioural commitment should be approached with caution When Microsoft proposed acquiring ZeniMax, it told the EC that “ it would not have the incentive to cease or limit making ZeniMax games available for purchase on rival consoles .” 29 Microsoft also publicly stated to investors that “ we highly encourage cross-platform play \[because\] if it’s good for the gaming ecosystem, it’s good for us…\[w\]e don’t have intentions of just pulling all of Bethesda content out of \[competitor platforms\] .” 30 But soon after the acquisition closed, Xbox’s head Phil Spencer revealed that, all along, the deal was about “ delivering great exclusive games ” for Xbox. Mr. Spencer later confirmed that the upcoming releases of two of Bethesda’s most popular titles, Starfield and Elder Scrolls , would be Xbox exclusives. In response to the news, Pete Hines, Bethesda’s marketing boss, said “ Sorry, all I can really say is, ‘I apologize,’ because I’m certain that’s frustrating to folks, but there’s not a whole lot I can do about it .” 33

# IV. Conclusion

29. In conclusion, to address the competitive harm caused to consoles and cloud gaming, the Transaction should be prohibited or subject to a structural remedy. SIE is extremely sceptical that an agreement with Microsoft could be reached, much less monitored and enforced effectively. As a result, a behavioural commitment that was designed to form the basis of an agreement between Microsoft and SIE should not be accepted by the CMA because there is no realistic prospect of such an agreement being reached that would maintain effective competition. More generally, behavioural remedies are unsuited to this case because of the lever they would give Microsoft over PlayStation and the difficulty the CMA would encounter in specifying, monitoring, policing, and enforcing any behavioural commitment.
