# THE MICROSOFT AND ACTIVISION MERGER INQUIRY ORDER 2023

# Background

1. On 15 September 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ), referred the anticipated acquisition by Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ) of Activision Blizzard, Inc. ( Activision ) (the Merger ) for further investigation and report by a group of CMA panel members.

2. The CMA published ‘ Anticipated acquisition by Microsoft of Activision Blizzard, Inc. Final report ’ (the Report ) on 26 April 2023. In the Report, the CMA decided, in accordance with section 36 of the Act, that:


(a) the anticipated acquisition of Activision by Microsoft constitutes arrangements in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation;

(b) the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) in the supply of cloud gaming services in the UK, due to vertical effects resulting from input foreclosure;

(c) the CMA should take action for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the SLC or any adverse effect which has resulted from, or may be expected to result from, the SLC; and

(d) the prohibition of the Merger would be the only effective and proportionate remedy to the SLC and any adverse effects which have resulted from, or may be expected to result from, the SLC.

3. On 5 May 2023, the CMA made an Interim Order pursuant to section 81 of the Act preventing each of Microsoft and Activision and all members of their Groups of Interconnected Bodies Corporate from acquiring in the other any interest conferring control within the meaning of section 26 of the Act.

4. On 19 May 2023, in accordance with paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 10 to the Act, the CMA gave notice of the proposed Order to remedy, mitigate or prevent the SLC and any resulting adverse effect, which it identified in the Report. The notice and the proposed Order were published on the CMA website. The CMA invited written representations on the proposed Order from any interested person or persons with a deadline of 19 June 2023.

5. In response to that notice, Microsoft made submissions to the CMA about developments since the publication of the Report. These submissions stated that there had been a material change of circumstances since the Report or that there were otherwise special reasons for reaching a different decision on the remedies question. Microsoft provided its final and consolidated submission on these matters on 25 July 2023.

6. A non-confidential version of Microsoft’s 25 July 2023 submission was published on the CMA’s website on 31 July 2023. On the same date, the CMA published a notice inviting comments on Microsoft’s submission with a deadline of 4 August 2023. The CMA received responses from interested parties in relation to Microsoft’s submission, as well as in response to the initial consultation on the proposed Order, which it has carefully considered.

7. The Inquiry Group has decided, under section 41(3) of the Act, that there has been no material change of circumstances since the preparation of the Report, and that the CMA has no special reasons for deciding differently. The Inquiry Group does not consider it otherwise necessary or appropriate to make modifications to the proposed Order. Accordingly, CMA now makes this Order today, to give effect to the remedy decision in the Report.

8. On the making of this Order, the reference is finally determined.
