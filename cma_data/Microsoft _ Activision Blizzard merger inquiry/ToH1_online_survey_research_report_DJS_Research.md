# 1Introduction

# Background, methodology and sample approach

# Background

DJS Research (DJS) was commissioned to conduct a survey to assist the CMA’s inquiry into the anticipated acquisition by Microsoft Corporation of Activision Blizzard Inc.

The research focused on the gaming habits and purchasing behaviour of PlayStation users whose account was used to play Call of Duty between July 2021 and June 2022.

# Sample source and design

The CMA requested a non-identifiable customer list from Sony. This included PlayStation account holders where the account had been used to play Call of Duty between July 2021 and June 2022. In order for the record to be retained in the sample frame, the PlayStation account was required to have been used to play Call of Duty for 10 hours or more, and/or they had spent at least $\\Phi100$ in the time period. A probability sample of around 50,000 records was selected, stratified on time spent online and time spent offline playing Call of Duty. Customer contact details including name and email address were requested for this sample.

The survey was administered online via email invites and was described as being around a five-minute questionnaire. An incentive of £10 was offered following an initial soft launch (where a £5 incentive was offered) and up to six reminders were issued to encourage a response.

# Research design

DJS worked with the CMA to finalise the questionnaire which was then piloted via 19 telephone interviews, whereby respondents could provide feedback and questions were tested for understanding (cognitive testing).

# Issued sample & respondents

40,000 sample records were emailed in batches:

•4,000 on 31st October (£5 incentive)

•10,000 on 2nd / 3rd November, this was split into four batches of 2,500 which were sent at different times (£5 incentive)

•11,000 on 4th November (£10 incentive)

•15,000 on 9th November (£10 incentive)

In total, 1,397 responses were achieved and the average time taken to complete the survey was five minutes and 46 seconds.

# Sample breakdown and response rate

# Sample breakdown

Of the 40,000 email invitations issued by DJS, 25 did not have a PlayStation account, 201 were ineligible due to being under the age of $^{18,}$ and 96 were not Call of Duty gamers. This resulted in 322 screen outs and a total of 1,397 interviews being completed. The eligibility rate was $81%$ .

# 2Summary of key findings

# Sample overview

DJS sent 40,000 invites to a sample of PlayStation account holders. We achieved 1,397 responses, which equates to a $4.4%$ response rate, taking into account the eligibility rate $(81%)$ .

# Gaming consoles and Call of Duty gaming

# Console ownership

The most popular PlayStation consoles owned were PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Around three in ten also own an $\\times\\mathsf{b}\\mathsf{o}\\mathsf{x},$ and a third own another console (mostly a gaming PC or Nintendo Switch).

# Main gaming device & usage

Gamers who own more than one console were more likely to say that they use their PlayStation as their main gaming device ‘almost all of the time’ $(65%)$ compared with those who use an Xbox $:40%)$ ) or another console ( $37%$ ) as their main gaming device.

# Future console purchases

Three quarters expected to buy a PlayStation next, with few saying that they planned on purchasing an Xbox ( $(6%)$ ), Nintendo $(6%),$ or other consoles.

# Factors influencing console purchase

The availability of games on PlayStation was overall the most influential factor to gamers when making a console purchase.

Three quarters of those who said game availability influenced them toward buying a PlayStation, also said that it was Call of Duty in particular that influenced them towards this purchase. This was closely followed by PlayStation Exclusive games, with seven in ten saying that this had influenced their decision to purchase a PlayStation.

# Call of Duty gaming

The most commonly owned Call of Duty game on PlayStation was Warzone (2020, free version), followed by Modern Warfare (2019). Gamers who own an Xbox or PC were most likely to have one or more of the older titles from the Call of Duty series.

The majority owned both pre-2020 and post-2020 Call of Duty games for PlayStation, whereas just under a quarter of those who own an Xbox owned both pre-2020 and post-2020 Call of Duty games.

Just over half of the gamers surveyed said they play games from the Call of Duty series several times a week or more $(53%)\_{i}$ ,with the most common frequency being to play several times per week (up to and including five times per week), at around three in ten $(31%)$ .

# Hypothetical scenarios

# Looking back to the purchase of their most recent PlayStation console

Respondents were asked to think back to when they bought their most recent PlayStation console.

Call of Duty game not available on PlayStation The first hypothetical scenario asked what gamers would have done if the most recent Call of Duty game they owned at the time had not been available on PlayStation but had been available on Xbox and PC.

In this scenario, just over half of gamers would have bought only the PlayStation $(53%)$ and around three in ten would have bought another device $(31%)$ , most commonly an Xbox $(61%)$ ). The most common response concerning the effect of this on their Call of Duty gaming was to have played only older Call of Duty games that they already owned $(41%)$ .

Call of Duty game is still available – but with fewer features Gamers were also asked what they would have done at the time of their last PlayStation purchase if the most recent Call of Duty game they owned at the time had still been available on PlayStation, but with less content. In this scenario, around two thirds would have bought only the PlayStation $(67%)$ , and around one in five would have bought another device $(21%)$ , most commonly an Xbox $(64%)$ .

# Looking forward

Respondents were asked to look forward to future Call of Duty game releases.

Likelihood of buying Call of Duty gaming releases Just over half $(52%)$ would be ‘very likely’ and a further third $(33%)$ would be ‘likely’ to buy future Call of Duty game releases. Overall, $85%$ would be likely to buy future Call of Duty game releases.

Future Call of Duty game releases not available on PlayStation Respondents were asked what they would do if they were to find that future Call of Duty game releases were not available on PlayStation

The most common course of action in response to this scenario would be to ‘play only Call of Duty games I already own, but not future releases’ ( $(34%)$ . Just over one in five say they would stop playing Call of Duty altogether $(21%)$ ), and just under a quarter $(24%)$ would buy another device (either an Xbox or PC) at their next gaming device purchase.

# Game availability

For respondents who said game availability influenced them towards buying a PlayStation, Call of Duty played a key role in purchasing behaviour. Just under three quarters of this demographic said that it was Call of Duty in particular that influenced them towards buying a PlayStation. This is closely followed by PlayStation Exclusive games, at around seven in ten.

# Call of Duty game ownership

Of the gamers surveyed, the most commonly owned Call of Duty game on PlayStation was Warzone (2020, free version), followed by Modern Warfare (2019). Gamers who own an Xbox or PC were most likely to have one or more older titles from the Call of Duty series on these devices.

# Recency of games owned

The majority of gamers owned both pre-2020 and post-2020 Call of Duty games for PlayStation, whereas just under a quarter $(23%)$ of those who also own an Xbox owned both pre-2020 and post-2020 Call of Duty games. Of those who own an Xbox, just over a quarter $(26%)$ only owned pre-2020 Call of Duty games. This suggests that those who own an Xbox are more likely to have purchased more recent Call of Duty games for their PlayStation. Those who own a PC, are less likely to own any Call of Duty games for their PC ( $68%$ do not own any Call of Duty games for PC).

# Hypothetical scenarios

The following sections focus on purely hypothetical scenarios, looking back at past purchasing behaviour and then looking forward to future purchasing behaviour. The aim of presenting these hypothetical scenarios to respondents is to encourage them to consider what course of action they would have taken or would take when faced with the following circumstances.

# Looking back to the purchase of their most recent PlayStation console

The first hypothetical scenario asked what gamers would have done if the most recent Call of Duty game they owned at the time had not been available on PlayStation.

In this scenario, just over half of gamers would have bought only the PlayStation $(53%)$ , and around three in ten would have bought another device $(31%)$ . Just under one in ten would have not bought any gaming device $(7%)$ .

# Likely effect on Call of Duty gaming: most recent Call of Duty game not available on PlayStation

Respondents were then asked how this scenario would have affected their Call of Duty gaming. The most likely outcome for gamers would have been to have played only the older Call of Duty games they already owned $(41%)$ . Just under a quarter $(23%)$ would have played the most recent Call of Duty game they owned on another device, and just over one in five $(22%)$ ) would have stopped playing Call of Duty altogether.

# Likely impact on non-Call of Duty gaming: most recent Call of Duty game not available on PlayStation

Those who said in this scenario that they would have bought an Xbox or PC, as well as a PlayStation, were then asked about other game purchases.

Gamers were also asked what they would have done at the time of their last PlayStation purchase if the most recent Call of Duty game they owned at the time had still been available on PlayStation, but with less content (not able to access certain content such as specific levels, maps or gameplay modes).

In this scenario, around two thirds of gamers said that they would have bought only the PlayStation $(67%)$ ). Just over one in ten would have bought another gaming device instead of the PlayStation $(12%)$ , and just under one in ten would have bought the PlayStation and another gaming device $(9%)$ .

# Looking forward

Respondents were then asked about buying any Call of Duty games that may be released in the near future (2023 and beyond).

# The most likely course of action if future Call of Duty game releases were not available on PlayStation

Respondents were asked what they would be likely to do if they were to find that future Call of Duty game releases were not available on PlayStation. In this scenario, the most common course of action would be to ‘play only Call of Duty games I already own, but not future releases’ $(34%)$ ). Just over one in five say they would stop playing the Call of Duty series altogether $(21%)$ ), and just under a quarter $(24%)$ would buy another device (either an Xbox or PC) at their next gaming device purchase.

# More about the CMA, your personal data and data protection

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the UK's competition regulator, is responsible for ensuring that consumers, like you, get a good deal when buying goods and services and that businesses operate within the law. As part of this work, it often asks existing customers of specific companies to participate in important consumer research. You can find out more about the CMA's work here or, if you prefer, by going to GOV.UK and typing 'CMA' into the search bar.

The CMA has asked DJS Research to survey UK PlayStation account holders to assist with its work. To enable DJS Research to conduct the survey, Sony has provided the CMA with the personal information of a randomly selected sample of around 50,000 of its PlayStation customers, including you. The CMA and DJS Research, as the CMA’s agent, are processing your personal data; our doing so is compliant with data protection law as set out in the UK GDPR and in the Data Protection Act 2018. We explain more about this below.

In legal terms, the purpose of the processing is in accordance with the CMA’s powers under Parts 1 and 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (EA02). The CMA's legal ground for processing your personal data is Article 6.1.(e) of the UK GDPR and section 8(c) of the Data Protection Act 2018, namely that it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority. Although the survey itself is voluntary, because the CMA has statutory powers to process your personal data, this means the CMA does not need your consent to process your personal data under data protection law.

The CMA has used its legal powers under section 109 of the Enterprise Act 2002 to require Sony to share certain items of personal data relating to a sample of around 50,000 of its UK PlayStation customers, including you, for the purposes of conducting a survey and for subsequent statistical analysis. The personal information provided is the minimum required for the CMA’s legal purposes, comprising: account number, year account created, name, e-mail address and date of birth, along with information on the ownership of PlayStation consoles, any subscription to PlayStation Plus, gameplay and gaming spend with Sony.

If you follow the survey link, we will also be processing your IP address as it will be collected automatically when you enter the survey. If you do not want the CMA and DJS Research to process your IP address you should not follow the link to the survey. If you do complete the survey, your answers will be combined with answers from everyone else who completes the survey to provide statistical results. It will not be possible to identify you in any results that are published or passed to third parties. While the CMA’s inquiry is ongoing, the CMA and DJS Research will continue to process your personal information securely at all times. Your personal information will be securely deleted on conclusion of the case.

You can read more about how the CMA, as a controller, processes personal data (including the contact details for the CMA's Data Protection Officer, information about your rights in relation to your personal data, and details of how to exercise those rights, including how to complain to the Information Commissioner's Officer) in the CMA's Privacy Notice. You can find a link to this document (titled 'Personal information charter') here (or, if you prefer, you can go to the CMA's homepage via GOV.UK and follow the links to the 'About us' page).
