Explanatory Note

This note is not a part of the Order

# Introduction

1. On 15 September 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act )referred the anticipated acquisition by Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ) of Activision Blizzard, Inc. ( Activision ) (the Merger ) for further investigation and report by a group of CMA panel members.

2. The CMA published ‘ Anticipated acquisition by Microsoft of Activision Blizzard, Inc. Final report ’ (the Report ) on 26 April 2023. In the Report, the CMA decided, in accordance with section 36 of the Act, that:


(a) the anticipated acquisition of Activision by Microsoft constitutes arrangements in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation;

(b) the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) in the supply of cloud gaming services in the UK, due to vertical effects resulting from input foreclosure;

(c) the CMA should take action for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the SLC or any adverse effect which has resulted from, or may be expected to result from, the SLC; and

(d) the prohibition of the Merger would be the only effective and proportionate remedy to the SLC and any adverse effects which have resulted from, or may be expected to result from, the SLC.

3. The CMA published a notice on 19 May 2023 of its intention to make an order to remedy the adverse effects on competition that it had identified.
