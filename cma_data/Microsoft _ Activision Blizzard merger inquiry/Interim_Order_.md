# ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION BY MICROSOFT CORPORATION OF ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.

Interim Order made by the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 81 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Whereas:

(a) On 15 September 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), in exercise of its duty under section 33(1) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act )referred the anticipated acquisition by Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ) of Activision Blizzard, Inc. ( Activision ) (the Merger ) for further investigation and report by a group of CMA panel members (the Reference ).

(b) The CMA published ‘ Anticipated acquisition by Microsoft of Activision Blizzard, Inc. Final report’ (the Report ) on 26 April 2023. In the Report, the CMA decided, in accordance with section 36 of the Act, that:

a. the anticipated acquisition of Activision by Microsoft constitutes arrangements in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation;

b. the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( SLC ) in the supply of cloud gaming services in the UK, due to vertical effects resulting from input foreclosure;

c. the CMA should take action for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the SLC or any adverse effect which has resulted from, or may be expected to result from, the SLC; and

d. the prohibition of the merger would be the only effective and proportionate remedy to the SLC and any adverse effects which have resulted from, or may be expected to result from, the SLC.

(c) The CMA wishes to ensure that no action is taken pending final determination of the Reference which might prejudice the Reference or impede the taking of any action by the CMA under Part 3 of the Act which might be justified by the CMA’s decisions on the Reference.

(d) The Reference has not yet been finally determined in accordance with section 79 of the Act.

(e) Now for the purpose of preventing pre-emptive action in accordance with section 81 of the Act, the CMA makes the following order ( Order ).
