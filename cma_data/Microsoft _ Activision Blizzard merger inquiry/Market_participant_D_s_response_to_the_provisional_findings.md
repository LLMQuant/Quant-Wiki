To whom it may concern,

Disclaimer: We would like to present our opinion anonymously.

The opinion is presented from the perspective of a developer and a publisher of AAA titles whose games are distributed on all major consoles (Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo), PC and mobile.

We are of the opinion that it is difficult to predict exact effects of the anticipated acquisition by Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") of Activision-Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision") (the "Merger"), in particular due to the complexity of the video game industry and diversity of Microsoftâ€™s own business operations. We do not, however, expect any significant impact of the Merger on our company nor distribution of our own products. In particular, we do not expect the Merger to pose any risks to the distribution of our own games on Xbox or other consoles.
