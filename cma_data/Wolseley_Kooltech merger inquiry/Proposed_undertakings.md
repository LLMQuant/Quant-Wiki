# ACQUISITION BY WOLSELEY UK LIMITED OF KOOLTECH LIMITED

Undertakings given by Wolseley UK Limited to the Competition and Markets Authority pursuant to section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002

# Whereas:

(a) Wolseley UK Limited ( Wolseley ) signed a share purchase agreement to acquire Kooltech Limited ( Kooltech ) (together the Parties ) on 23 December 2022 (the Transaction );

(b) Under section 33 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act ) the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) has a duty to refer a relevant merger situation for a Phase 2 investigation where it believes that it is or may be the case that the creation of that merger situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or services;

(c) Under section 73 of the Act the CMA may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it, accept undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate, from such of the parties concerned as it considers appropriate. In particular, the CMA shall have regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(d) As set out in the CMA’s decision of 23 November 2023 (the Decision ), the CMA believes that, in the absence of appropriate undertakings, it would be under a duty to refer the Transaction for a Phase 2 investigation;

(e) The CMA considers that the undertakings given below by the Parties are appropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from the Transaction, or may be expected to result from it, as specified in the Decision; and

(f) Prior to the acceptance of these undertakings by the CMA, the Parties entered into a legally binding agreement of \[date\] to divest the Divestment Business as a going concern to a Proposed Purchaser on terms approved by the CMA. This agreement was conditional only on formal CMA approval of the Proposed Purchaser and acceptance by the CMA of these undertakings. This agreement includes a warranty that the Proposed Purchaser has the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Business as part of a viable and active business in competition with Wolseley and other competitors in the wholesale supply of air-conditioning products and wholesale supply of refrigeration products on a local basis to satisfy urgent demand where delivery is not a preferred option in Aberdeen.

NOW THEREFORE the Parties hereby give to the CMA the following undertakings for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition, or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it or may be expected to result from it.

# 1EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE UNDERTAKINGS

1.1 These undertakings shall take effect from the date that, having been signed by the Parties, they are accepted by the CMA.

# 2DIVESTMENT OF THE DIVESTMENT BUSINESS

2.3 In the event that the Parties fail to complete the divestment of the Divestment Business in accordance with paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 above, the CMA may, whether or not initiating the Trustee Functions as set out in paragraph 4 below, require the Parties to divest the Divestment Business as a going concern at no minimum price to a purchaser or purchasers approved by the CMA.

# 3APPROVAL OF PURCHASER AND TERMS OF DIVESTMENT

3.1 For the purposes of the CMA approving a Proposed Purchaser and the terms of the divestment of the Divestment Business in accordance with these undertakings, the Parties shall, save as required or permitted by the CMA, satisfy the CMA that:

(a) the acquisition by the Proposed Purchaser of the Divestment Business, on the terms set out above, remedies, mitigates or prevents the substantial lessening of competition concerned or any adverse effect which has or may have resulted from it, or may be expected to result from it, in particular having regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to the substantial lessening of competition and any adverse effects resulting from it;

(b) the Proposed Purchaser is independent of and unconnected to the Parties and the Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate to which the Parties belong and any Associated Person or Affiliate of the Parties or such Group of Interconnected Bodies Corporate;

(c) the Proposed Purchaser has the financial resources, expertise (including the managerial, operational and technical capability), incentive and intention to maintain and operate the Divestment Business as a viable and active business in competition with Wolseley and Kooltech and other competitors in the markets for the wholesale supply of air conditioning products and refrigeration products from the date of completion of the divestment of the Divestment Business;

(d) the Proposed Purchaser is reasonably to be expected to obtain all necessary approvals, licences and consents from any regulatory or other authority, including (where applicable) landlord’s consent to the transfer of any leasehold interest; and

(e) the acquisition by the Proposed Purchaser of the Divestment Business does not create a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK.
