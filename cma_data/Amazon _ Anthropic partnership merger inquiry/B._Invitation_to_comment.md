# AMAZON.COM, INC’S PARTNERSHIP WITH ANTHROPIC PBC

# INVITATION TO COMMENT: CLOSES ON 9 MAY 2024

Amazon.com, Inc. ( Amazon ) has entered into a partnership with Anthropic PBC (Anthropic ) to advance generative artificial intelligence ( AI ). As part of the partnership, Amazon will become Anthropic’s primary cloud provider for certain workloads, including agreements for purchasing computing capacity and non-exclusive commitments to make Anthropic models available on Amazon Bedrock. Amazon has provided $\\mathfrak{S4}$ billion in funding to Anthropic, including $\\mathbb{52.75}$ billion on 27 March 2024.

The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) is considering whether it is or may be the case that the Amazon/Anthropic partnership has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services. The CMA is keen to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to make their views known and present all relevant evidence to the CMA. The CMA is therefore issuing this preliminary ‘invitation to comment’ asking all interested parties to submit to the CMA any initial views on: (1) whether the partnership has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the Enterprise Act 2002 and (2) if so, the impact that the partnership could have on competition in the UK. The invitation to comment is the first part of the CMA’s information-gathering process, in advance of any decision to launch a phase 1 investigation.

The CMA may proactively contact companies and organisations that are active in the markets affected by the partnership or have valuable insights or evidence that could assist the CMA’s investigation.

To assist it with this investigation, the CMA invites comments from any interested party. Comments should be provided by the deadline set out above to: Principal Case Officer name: Rob Fitzgerald-Crisp E-mail: [Rob.Fitzgerald-Crisp@cma.gov.uk](mailto:Rob.Fitzgerald-Crisp@cma.gov.uk) Tel no: 020 3738 6276
