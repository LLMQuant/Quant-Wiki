### Invitation to comment: closed
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering whether it is or may be the case that Amazon’s partnership with Anthropic has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.
To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments from any interested party, in advance of the CMA’s formal investigation starting.
These comments should be provided by the deadline set out above.
